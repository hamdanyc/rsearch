In the first case  how the tool would handle a similar yet distinct cascade   TLR5  was evaluated. Although there are differences between the TLR4 and TLR5 signaling cascades  the  experimental and modeling data were closely aligned  and the data looked similar regardless of whether NF B  activation or transcription of IL 1  was used as the readout system  further validating the utility of the model.  Next  to address multiple interconnected signaling cascades  the modeling process was evaluated by creating a  model that combined both TLR4 and TLR5 cascades. This was done by using software to first generate models for  TLR4 and TLR5 individually  and subsequently using an additional feature of the software to combine the two  existing models to create a new dual signaling model. The experimental and modeling data when TLR4 and TLR5  signaling cascades were simultaneously activated were then evaluated. Once again the modeling data recapit   ulated the experimental data with both sets of data showing that dual signaling leads to competition between the  signaling cascades. Collectively  these results show the adaptability and power of the modeling and experimental  systems to investigate multiple interconnected TLR signaling cascades.    1.Introduction  Cells of the innate immune system are often the first to encounter a  potential pathogen. This initial encounter is facilitated by pattern  recognition receptors  PRRs  on innate white blood cells such as mac  rophages  neutrophils  and dendritic cells which recognize pathogen  associated molecular patterns  PAMPs  on potential pathogens  1 3 .  Cells of the defense system express a variety of different PRRs which  ensures that a wide range of potential pathogens can be recognized   1 3 . For instance  TLR2 recognizes peptidoglycan on gram positive  bacteria  TLR4 recognizes lipopolysaccharide  LPS  on gram negative  bacteria  TLR5 recognizes flagellin on a variety of bacteria  and TLR3  recognizes viral double stranded RNA  4 7 . In total  humans express 10  different TLRs and any given cell may express a range of PRRs. Human  monocytes which patrol the body looking for potential pathogens for  example express TLRs 1  2  4  5  6  8  and 9  8 . Because of the impor   tance of what happens following the initial interaction between the  defense system and a pathogen a great deal of research has focused on understanding the signaling cascades downstream of these PRRs and the  details of most TLR signaling cascades are now known.  One of the first TLR signaling cascades to be delineated was the TLR4  cascade. Upon binding to LPS  TLR4 forms a homodimer bringing  together the Toll interleukin  IL  1R homology  TIR  domains of TLR4  and Myd88. The N terminal death domain  DD  of Myd88 then associ   ates with the DD of IL 1 receptor associated kinase 2  IRAK2  and IRAK4  molecules to form the myddosome complex composed of multiple  molecules of Myd88  IRAK2  and IRAK4  9 . Formation of the myddo   some complex leads to recruitment and activation of TRAF6  TAK1   TAB1  3  among other signaling proteins  and ends with activation of  NF B which then translocates to the nucleus to transcribe genes such as  IL 1   TNF    and IL 6  10 . Signaling through other TLRs utilize many of  these same components for their signaling cascades. For instance  upon  agonist binding all TLR  except TLR3  associate with the adaptor protein  Myd88  10 . Yet  despite the wealth of knowledge of TLR signaling  cascades  most of what is known about TLR signaling is limited because  it comes from investigations focused on how a cell responds to a single  TLR agonist even though studies have shown that the response can differ   Corresponding author.

For instance   tumor cells and dendritic cells exhibit a different response when mul  tiple interconnected cascades are triggered  11 . Along this same line   Bafica et al.  12   reported that the response to Mycobacterium tubercu   losis differed when TLR2  TLR9  or the combination of these two re  ceptors were triggered. Moreno et al.  13   reported that activation of  two TLR signaling cascades with multiple agonists had a different  outcome when compared to activation of a single TLR signaling cascade   dual TLR7 and TLR9 signaling impaired NF B activation. And  Han et al.   14   reported crosstalk between the hypoxia inducible factor 1  HIF 1    TLR3 and TLR4 signaling cascades. Collectively  these data indicate that  a cell can respond differently when it is exposed to one versus multiple  agonists  and likely explains why cells in different environments exhibit  different TLR signaling capabilities  15 . Consequently  although  exploring and deciphering multiple interconnected signaling cascades is  challenging  the results from such studies are critical because they may  better recapitulate the immune response to pathogens which normally  simultaneously trigger signaling cascades downstream of multiple PRRs.  As a case in point  when an epithelial cell encounters a common gram  negative bacterium such as Escherichia coli  E. coli  both TLR4 and TLR5  signaling ensues because the bacteria express both LPS and flagellin   16 . Similarly  peptidoglycan from gram     bacteria can concurrently  trigger TLR2 as well as NOD like receptor  NLR  signaling  17   and  RNA viruses can trigger TLR7 and RIG like receptor  RLR  signaling   18 . Likewise  Mycobacterium bovis in the BCG vaccine is known to be a  powerful adjuvant and cancer treatment in part because of its ability to  simultaneously trigger TLR2  TLR4 and TLR9 signaling  19 21 . The  latter example  underscores how an understanding of multiple inter  connected signaling cascades may facilitate the design of new TLR ag  onists that could be used as vaccine adjuvants  22 23  or cancer  treatments  24 25 .  It is for some of these reasons that an experimental approach in  combination with computational modeling is needed to learn more  about interconnected TLR signaling cascades. Modeling can provide  data that not only contributes to an understanding of interconnected  signaling cascades  but can also be used to make predictions about the  best targets in a signaling cascade to increase or decrease the desired cell  response  and inform investigators what experiments should be done  next. However  building a new model can be a complex  time consuming  process. The solution was to develop a tool that could create executable  models from a description.  Previously  the tool was used to create a model of the TLR4 signaling  cascade  11   and in this study the model was expanded to include the  TLR5 signaling cascade. In comparing TLR4 and TLR5 signaling cas  cades using experimental and modeling data it was found that the  modeling data recapitulated the experimental data showing a dose  dependent response to TLR4 and TLR5 signaling  and that the TLR4  response to LPS was more sensitive than the TLR5 response to flagellin.  The experimental and modeling data were also evaluated when both  TLR4 and TLR5 signaling cascades were activated together. The data  further validated the utility of the modeling approach because once  again the modeling data recapitulated the experimental data with both  sets of data indicating that dual signaling leads to competition between  the signaling cascades. Finally  data from the dual signaling studies  revealed that the model could be improved by taking into account  greater transcriptional regulation of gene expression because this was  one area where the modeling data and experimental data displayed different results.  2.Material and methods  2.1. Cells  The THP 1 monocyte cell line containing the NF B reporter system   Invivogen  San Diego  CA  was maintained in 25 cm2 culture flasks with  complete RPMI  cRPMI   RPMI 1640  Lonza  Walkersville  MD  sup  plemented with 10  heat inactivated fetal bovine serum  Lonza   and  penicillin  100U mL  Lonza  and streptomycin  100  g mL  Lonza . The  cells were maintained at 37  C with 5  CO2 and split three times week.  2.2. Treatment with TLR agonists  For each experiment the cells were adjusted to 5.6  105 cells ml and  180ul of cells were added to each well of a 96 well flat bottom plate.  Triplicate wells for each treatment condition were used  and flagellin   Invivogen  and lipopolysaccharide  LPS  Invivogen  were used for  TLR5 and TLR4 agonists respectively at 0.05  0.5 and 5.0ug ml. The  concentration of agonists were adjusted so that 10ul was added for each  treatment condition. An equal volume of saline was added to each  control well. The cells were incubated at 37  C  5  CO2 for 24 h before  analysis.  2.3. NF B reporter assay  Following treatment with the TLR agonists 20ul of cell supernatant  was removed from each well and added to new wells in another 96 well  plate with 180ul Quanti Blue solution  Invivogen . The assay was then  incubated at 37  C  5  CO2 for 1 h. Optical density for each well was  recorded at 620 nm using a plate reader  Tecan  Mannedorf   Switzerland . NF B activation was reported as a stimulation index  relative to control.  2.4. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  Following treatment with the TLR agonists gene expression was  analyzed by qRT PCR. For this purpose  the cells were pulled together  from the triplicate wells and RNA was isolated using the Aurum Total  RNA Mini Kit  Bio Rad Laboratories  Hercules  CA  according to man  ufacturer  s instructions. Briefly  the cells were lysed  RNA was bound to  the column  treated with DNase  and following several washes  RNA was  eluted and stored at  20  C. Complementary DNA was generated using  the iScript cDNA synthesis kit  Bio Rad Laboratories . For this purpose  15ul RNA  4ul 5x iScript buffer and 1ul iScript reverse transcriptase  were combined in a 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and placed in a thermal  cycler  MiniCycler  MJ Research Watertown  MA . The reaction condi   tions consisted of 25  C for 5 min  42  C for 30 min  and then 85  C for 5  min. All samples were stored at  20  C prior to qRT PCR. An aliquot   0.5ul  of cDNA was amplified in a reaction with 1x iQ SYBR Green  Supermix  Bio Rad Laboratories  and 200 nM gene specific primers. The  reaction conditions consisted of 40 cycles of a two step PCR reaction  with 94  C for 10 s  and 68  C for 30 s on an iQ5 Real Time PCR Detection  System  Bio Rad Laboratories .

Models  Previously  a tool was developed to generate an agent based simu  lation model of a cell signaling cascade  11 . The tool takes as input a  specification  description  of the components and interactions in a  signaling cascade and uses it to create a simulation model in Netlogo. In  the specification each type of component was given a unique name   location  external to the cell  cell membrane  cytoplasm  nucleus    shape  and color so that each type of component could be distinguished.  Each interaction in the cascade could either enable  stimulate  or disable   inhibit  other interactions. Initial ratios of the components were based  on lab based data using quantitative PCR to determine the level of each  component  and then through iterative trials the relative ratios of the  agent populations was determined in the model that led to results that  matched those of the lab experiments. The ratios of the agent pop  ulations accounted for differences such as the size and velocity of the  agents when determining how frequently interactions between agents  occurred.  The simulated cell was divided into four areas   outside the cell  the  cell membrane  cytoplasm  nucleus   and each type of signaling  component was located in its specified location. During each simulated  time step  components moved in a random direction within their cellular  area simulating Brownian movement. If the necessary conditions were  met  proximity and state of the participating components   stimulatory  or inhibitory interactions occurred. Movement of components from one  location in the cell to another  e.g. an activated transcriptional factor  moving from the cytoplasm to the nucleus  required the user to specify  in the tool that the component was created in the new location as a result  of a stimulatory or inhibitory interaction. The tool was written in the  Scala language  version 2.13.3  and runs on the Ubuntu  20.04  operating system. The tool reads in the model specifications and gen  erates an executable model in Netlogo. The executable Netlogo pro  grams were generated for the Netlogo 6.0.1 environment.  The specification of the cascade includes the size of the population of  each component type and the volume  size  of the cell. When the  simulation model initiated execution  the equivalent number of each  component type was instantiated and the simulation then began. Each  simulation experiment was run 5 times for 200 000 time steps and the  results were averaged. While there was variance for the values at any  single time step for each of the runs  the data were not compared point  by point  but rather trends  the shape of the plots  were compared and  these remained the same between each of the runs. The characteristics  that were analyzed included  1  the general shape of each plot  and  2   how the plots changed as the experimental values  number of each type  of component  changed. For example  how the peak value of the  response changed when the dose of the agonist was increased   decreased  or how the shape of the plot changed when a low high dose  of a second agonist was added.  3.Results  3.1. Experimental and modeling data for the single TLR signaling  cascades  In order to study the TLR signaling cascade the THP 1 cell line  transfected with a NF B reporter was used. Exposure of the cells to LPS  to trigger TLR4 signaling  or flagellin to trigger TLR5 signaling resulted  in similar yet distinct patterns of NF B activation  Fig. 1a and c .  Sensitivity of TLR4 and TLR5 signaling differed with 0.05ug ml of LPS  resulting in significant NF B activation  whereas 0.05  g ml of flagellin  did not induce NF B activation. In addition  NF B activation peaked  with 0.5ug ml of LPS  whereas 5ug ml of flagellin resulted in the  Fig. 1.Experimental data for single TLR4  and TLR5 signaling cascades. To investigate  TLR4 and TLR5 signaling cascades the THP   1 cell line was stimulated with LPS or  flagellin to trigger TLR4 or TLR5 signaling  respectively. As a readout system for the  signaling cascades NF B activation  a  c  or  NF B induced transcription of IL 1   b  d   was used. All data are the average and stan  dard error of at least three separate experi   ments. Where indicated     significant  differences were found relative to the control   0 treatment group  p D0.05 using a Stu  dent s t Test .   C.W. Liew et al.

To validate that activation of NF B correlated  with NF B induced gene transcription we assessed IL 1  gene expression  by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR  qRT PCR  in THP 1 cells  treated with LPS or flagellin. The data showed that the pattern of IL 1   gene expression matched the pattern of NF B activation for each TLR  agonist  Fig. 1 . Collectively  these data showed that the THP 1 cells  respond to LPS and flagellin with NF B activation and IL 1  gene  expression  and the cells exhibit a different sensitivity to the TLR4 and  TLR5 agonists.  Each simulation for the model ran for 200 000 time steps generating  data  Fig. 2a and b  that was extrapolated and compared with the  experimental data. The total NF B activation was quantified during the  first 100 000 time steps of the simulation which was where the model  showed most NF B activation. Strikingly  the pattern of NF B activation  for the TLR4 and TLR5 models closely aligned with the experimental  data. TLR4 signaling resulted in more rapid activation of NF B and a  response that peaked at a lower dose of LPS as compared to TLR5  signaling  Fig. 2c and d . Together  these data showed that the TLR4 and  TLR5 models were capable of generating data that recapitulate the  experimental data. 3.2. Experimental and modeling data for the dual TLR signaling cascades  Since cells rarely receive a single signal at any given time there was  interest in creating a more realistic experimental system utilizing mul  tiple agonists  LPS and flagellin. In order to generate data over a range of  doses for LPS and flagellin experiments were run with a cell receiving 3  different doses of LPS in combination with 3 different doses of flagellin   Fig. 3 . There was a strong response with a single agonist and then   upon addition of the second agonist  in a dose dependent manner the  response began to decrease. These data indicated that the cell did not  respond in a synergistic manner when both signals were given to the cell.  Interestingly  unlike the experiments for the single TLR signaling cas  cades  there was a small difference in the data when using NF B versus  IL 1  gene expression as the readout system for the dual signaling ex  periments. The data using IL 1  gene expression as the readout system  showed the response decreased earlier than when NF B activation was  used as the readout system. Most of the IL 1  response was gone when  the cells were treated with LPS and 0.05ug ml of flagellin  Fig. 3b .  Whereas  most of the NF B response was not gone until the cells were  treated with LPS and 5  g ml of flagellin  Fig. 3a .  To create more complex models that could react to multiple agonists   a new algorithm was developed that combined the TLR4 and TLR5  models into a dual signaling model  Fig. 4 . For simplicity  the figure  Fig. 2.Modeling data for single TLR4 and TLR5 signaling cascades. To evaluate the ability of the model to simulate similar  yet distinct signaling cascades the TLR4   a  c  and TLR5  b  d  signaling cascades were modeled. The model was used to determine how much NF B would be activated following initiation of the cascades  with different levels of LPS or flagellin for the TLR4 and TLR5 cascades respectively. C.W. Liew et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100939 5shows a single copy of each component of the signaling cascade  but  each simulated cell contained 25 TLR4 proteins  75 TLR5  10 Myd88   500 TRIF  25 IRAK1  and 50 of each of the following IRAK2  IRAK4   TRAF6  TAK1  ubc13  IKK  TAB1  TAB2  TAB3  IKB  and NF B. These  numbers were determined in part by previous work  11 . The algorithm  identifies the components and interactions that are common to both  cascades. The identified components and interactions are then used to  correctly sequence the interactions in the new  combined  model. The  results showed that the dual signaling model generated data that once  again recapitulated the experimental data  Fig. 5 . The simulation model  also did not respond in a synergistic manner when stimulated with both  agonists  Fig. 5b . Collectively  these data support the contention that  transcriptional regulation is more complicated when the cell is exposed  to two signals  and that dual TLR4 TLR5 signaling does not result in a  synergistic response  but rather enhanced negative feedback or compe   tition between the signaling cascades.  3.3. The decreased response to dual signaling is not attributed to  enhanced negative feedback  To investigate downregulation of the cellular response upon dual  signaling expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling were  examined. Since IRAKM was previously shown to function as a negative  regulator of TLR4 signaling  11   experiments were conducted to  determine whether IRAKM could function as a negative regulator when  the cells were exposed to dual signaling by treating the cells with  different doses of LPS and flagellin and quantifying IRAKM gene  expression  Fig. 6a . In addition  expression of two additional negative  regulators of TLR signaling  RP105 and Myd88s were also examined   Fig. 6b and c . The data showed no significant increase in expression of  any of these negative regulators  supporting the contention that  enhanced negative feedback was not likely responsible for the decreased  response evident upon dual signaling. In order to model the possibility  that competition between the signaling cascades could be responsible  for the decreased response upon dual signaling  the simulation model  was run with increasing levels of Myd88 present in the simulated cell.  The data showed that increasing Myd88 levels led to an increase in the  response to dual signaling  Fig. 6d . Since increasing the levels of a  signaling protein would alleviate decreased availability due to compe   tition between the signaling cascades  these modeling data support the  contention that competition between the signaling cascades may be  responsible for the decreased response evident upon dual signaling.  Fig. 3.Experimental data for the dual signaling cascades. To experimentally investigate dual signaling cascades the THP 1 cell line was stimulated with varying  doses of both LPS and flagellin to trigger TLR4 and TLR5 signaling respectively. As a readout system for the signaling cascades NF B activation  a   or NF B induced  transcription of IL 1   b  was used. All data are the average and standard error of at least three separate experiments. Where indicated     significant differences were  found relative to the control  0  g ml LPS  at each dose p D0.05 using a Student  s t Test .  Fig. 4.Depiction of the dual signaling model. The initial TLR4 model was  modified so that it could also be used for the TLR5 signaling cascade. These two  separate cascades were then combined in order to model multiple  yet inter  connected signaling cascades. C.W.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100939 63.4. Analysis of dual signaling reveals greater complexity at the  transcriptional level  To further investigate NF B induced transcriptional regulation upon  dual signaling expression of two additional genes  IL 6 and TNF     were  quantified. Upon analysis of the single TLR4 and single TLR5 cascades  the pattern of IL 6 and TNF    expression was the same as the pattern of  IL 1  expression and NF B activation  Figs. 1  7a and 7b  7d  7e    although most of the data for IL 6 and TNF    expression were not sta  tistically significant. However  when the cells were exposed to both LPS  and flagellin IL 6 and TNF    gene expression did not show the same  pattern as IL 1  gene expression or NF B activation  Figs. 3  7c and 7f .  In response to dual signaling there was a clear dose dependent inhibitory  response for NF B activation and IL 1  gene expression  Fig. 3  that was not evident with IL 6 or TNF    gene expression  Fig. 7c and f . These  data underscore a potential fundamental difference in how the cells  respond at the transcriptional level to single versus dual signaling  and  indicate that the model could be improved by taking into account  greater transcriptional regulation of gene expression.  4.Discussion  Modeling can provide data that not only contributes to the under   standing of complex signaling cascades  but can also be informative of  what experiments should be done next  can be used to make predictions  about the best targets in a signaling cascade to increase or decrease the  desired cell response  and provide information about how cells or even  patients may respond to pharmacological interventions.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100939 7approaches have been used to model cell signaling cascades including  some of which have focused on TLR4 signaling. For example  Razvan  et al.  26   used a series of differential equations to represent movement  of TLR4 within a cell. Depending upon the location  the activity of TLR4  was ascribed a pro  or anti inflammatory role aimed at allowing in  vestigators to associate TLR4 signaling with the outcome of patients  with sepsis. Rivi ere et al.  27   also modeled TLR4 signaling using dif  ferential equations. They used data from their model to make pre  dictions about how the TLR4 signaling cascade would differ in the  presence or absence of preconditioning  27 . Padra et al.  28   used a  computational approach  molecular dynamic simulations  to study the  structure of TLR4 dimers in the plasma membrane. Since the structural  organization of TLR4 in the plasma membrane is critical for ligand  binding  as well as signal initiation  the model provides information that  could be used to help design TLR4 agonists or antagonists. T aubner et al.   29   also used a computational approach and attempted to develop a  program to automate the process of extracting TLR4 signaling infor  mation from a database  generating a model  running a simulation  and  analyzing the data. Finally  Gary An  30  used an agent based model in  Netlogo to study the TLR4 signaling cascade. He generated a stochastic  system capable of depicting the dynamics of TLR4 signaling including a  dose dependent response as well as negative feedback. Our approach is  somewhat similar with a Netlogo model and an iterative process of using  modeling data to inform the experimental design  and using experi   mental data to improve the model  11 . Additionally  instead of devel   oping  and debugging  each new model  a tool was created that would  use a  non executable  specification of a model to create an equivalent executable version. The tool was initially used to create executable  versions of the TLR4 and TLR5 signaling cascades. These models had to  be  tuned    i.e.  parameter values were adjusted so that the behavior of  the simulation models matched the experimental data. In this study  the  tool was further enhanced so that it could combine two models and  create a more complex model that combined the two basic models.  Furthermore  the utility of the modeling approach was evaluated in two  dimensions   generality  evaluating whether the model was amenable to  other TLR cascades  and power  modeling a combination of cascades .  In the current study the previous model for TLR4 signaling  11  was  improved upon by adjusting the model so that it could also be used for  another TLR signaling cascade  TLR5. Perhaps due to the amount of  overlap between the TLR4 and TLR5 signaling cascades it should come  as no surprise that the model was easily adjusted to the TLR5 signaling  cascade. However  as evident from the experimental and modeling data   the cellular response to TLR4 and TLR5 signaling were unique. TLR4  signaling was initiated and peaked at a lower dose of agonist than TLR5  signaling. These data suggest that TLR4 and TLR5 signaling have  different sensitivities to their agonists. However  since pathogens have  more than one PAMP  a more biologically relevant experimental system  and model should take into account what happens when multiple TLRs  are activated in the same cell at the same time.  The importance of understanding dual signaling  or the interactions  between multiple interconnected signaling cascades  is exemplified by  studies aimed at targeting multiple pathways in disease processes. For  instance  cancer therapies that target multiple pathways  24 25 31 32   may be more successful than targeting a single pathway. Likewise  the  Fig. 6.Dual signaling did not induce enhanced expression of negative regulators. To investigate whether dual signaling cascades induced expression of negative  regulators of TLR signaling the THP 1 cell line was stimulated with varying doses of both LPS and flagellin and qRT PCR was used to quantitate IRAKM  a   RP105  b   and Myd88s  c  gene expression. All data are the average and standard error of at least three separate experiments. d  Modeling data revealed that increasing Myd88  levels could lead to a synergistic response to dual signaling.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100939 8immune response to infectious diseases is inherently the result of mul  tiple interconnected signaling cascades  16 18   and development of  adjuvants can also benefit from a greater understanding of how multiple  signaling cascades interact  22 23 33 .  While some studies have experimentally explored multiple TLR  signaling cascades  34 37  there are a paucity of models that can be  used to simulate multiple interconnected signaling cascades. For  instance  each simulation model of a cascade reflects the knowledge  gained from experiments in the lab on that cascade in isolation. The  models cannot be easily combined because the common components   signaling proteins  interact and affect the joint behavior. For this study  an algorithm was developed that analyses two  or more  models of  cascades and determines the components and interactions that they  have in common. The algorithm uses that knowledge to create a new   more complex model that combines the pieces of the two models and  sequences the interactions correctly. The algorithm improves the  modeling process as creating a new model from scratch to represent the  combined cascades would take a great deal more effort and time. In  order to assess the algorithm for this purpose the individual TLR4 and  TLR5 models were combined into a dual signaling model. The com  plexities of the models and the degree to which they interact are shown  in Table 1. The TLR4 and TLR5 specifications differ in a small number of  components and interactions. If the specifications were very different   creating a new model would be fairly easy as there would be few in  terdependencies between the components and the interactions. What makes the TLR4 TLR5 model difficult to construct is the analysis  required to determined where the interactions should occur in the  combined cascade.  To evaluate the dual signaling model simulations of how a cell would  respond to both LPS and flagellin were run  and then the modeling data  and experimental data were compared. The dual modeling data reca  pitulated the experimental data showing that there was no synergistic  response evident when the cell received signals through both TLR4 and  TLR5  both NF B activation and IL 1  expression levels decreased upon  dual signaling. These data could be explained by enhanced negative  feedback or competition between the signaling cascades. The lack of an  increase in expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling  IRAKM   RP 105  Myd88s  support the contention that competition between the  cascades could be responsible for the decreased response evident when  the cells were exposed to two signals. In support of this possibility   modeling data revealed that increasing Myd88 levels resulted in an  increased response to dual signaling. Future experiments could validate  these modeling data by creating cell lines with different baseline levels  of Myd88  or other TLR signaling proteins  and then examining the  response to dual signaling.  The dual signaling data also revealed that there was concordance  between the model and the NF B and IL 1  experimental data  but not  the IL 6 and TNF    experimental data. These data suggest that following  a single readout system of the signaling cascades such as NF B activation  or IL 1  gene expression may result in missing the finer details of what is  happening at the transcriptional level during the cellular response to  multiple PAMPs. In order to take into consideration greater transcrip   tional regulation an additional transcriptional factor important for TLR  signaling such as IRF could be incorporated into the model  38 . Indeed   ongoing studies aim to expand the model and experimental system to  investigate activation of both NF B and IRF upon dual TLR4 TLR5  signaling. Furthermore  eventually it will be important to expand the  model and experimental system beyond the two signaling cascades. For  Fig. 7.Analysis of dual signaling reveals a different pattern of transcriptional regulation for IL 6 and TNF   . To investigate additional genes transcribed by NF B the  THP 1 cell line was stimulated with LPS and or flagellin to trigger individual  a  b  d  e  and dual  c  f  TLR signaling cascades. As a readout system qRT PCR was used  to assess IL 6 and TNF    gene expression. All data are the average and standard error of at least three separate experiments. Where indicated     significant dif  ferences were found relative to the control p D0.05 using a Student  s t Test .  Table 1  Complexity of the models and degree of interactions.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100939 9this purpose the model and experimental system could be expanded to  three different PRRs by studying TLR4  TLR5 and TLR7 cascades which  could be used to model what happens when a cell encounters more than  one pathogen  in this case a bacteria  TLR4  TLR5 cascades  and a virus   TLR7 cascade .  In summary  in this study a modeling tool was extended with an  algorithm that could create new  more complex models by combining  the pieces of two different models and sequencing the interactions  correctly. How the newly created model would handle single and dual  TLR4 TLR5 signaling cascades and whether choice of the readout sys  tem would impact the outcome was then evaluated. Although there were  differences between the single TLR4 and TLR5 signaling cascades  the  experimental and modeling data were closely aligned  and the data  looked similar regardless of whether NF B activation or transcription of  IL 1   IL 6  or TNF    were used as readout systems. However  data from  the dual signaling studies revealed that the model could be improved by  taking into account greater transcriptional regulation of gene expression  because the response to LPS and flagellin differed when using NF B and  IL 1  versus IL 6 and TNF    as readout systems. Finally  although  ongoing studies are focused on expanding the model and experimental  system to an additional TLR and transcriptional factor  future studies  should also take into account additional PRRs. For instance  Rig 1 like  receptors  RLRs   C type lectin receptors  CLRs   and NOD like receptors   NLRs  complement the TLRs to ensure many different PAMPs can be  recognized by the defense system  39 . In short  the adaptability of the  modeling approach will be instrumental in studying the complex nature  of such interconnected signaling cascades.
