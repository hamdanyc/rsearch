It affects millions of people in the world and thousands of people in Ethiopia. In responding to this   digital health technologies help to reduce COVID 19 outbreaks by sharing accurate and timely COVID 19 related  information. Additionally  digital solutions are used for remote consulting during the pandemic  in creating  COVID 19 related awareness  for distribution of the vaccine  and so on. Therefore  this study aimed to assess  digital health literacy to share COVID 19 related information and associated factors among healthcare providers  who worked at COVID 19 treatment centers in the Amhara region  Northwest Ethiopia.  Method  An institutional based cross sectional survey was conducted from April 4 to May 4  2021. The study  included 476 healthcare providers who worked at COVID 19 treatment centers in the Amhara region. A pre  tested  structured self administered questionnaire was used to collect data. EpiData 4.6 and SPSS version 26 were  used for data entry and analysis respectively. Bi variable and Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used  to identify factors associated with the dependent variable. A P value of less than 0.05 was used to declare sta  tistical significance.  Result  A total of 456 respondents were participated in the study  with 95.8  response rate. Digital health literacy  to share COVID 19 related information found to be 50.4   95  CI  46 55 .

Conclusion  This finding indicated that approximately half of the respondents had digital health literacy to share  COVID 19 related information which was inadequate. Improving respondents   educational status  computer  training  smartphone access  perceived usefulness  perceived ease of use  and attitude was necessary to measure  digital health literacy to sharing of COVID 19 related information.    1.Background  Coronavirus  CoV  is a novel respiratory virus that can cause severe  acute respiratory syndrome  SARS   1 . It was first identified in Wuhan   China  in December 2019 and has quickly spread to every part of the  globe  2 . The common sign and symptoms of this virus was fever   cough  and shortness of breath  vomiting  diarrhea  and abdominal pain  3 4 . The coronavirus disease  COVID 19  has a high rate of trans   mission  making it difficult to control the progress  5 . It affects more  than 355.6 million people in the world  10.8 million people in Africa   and 462 514 people in Ethiopia based on the world health organization   WHO  report of January 2022. The virus has no effective treatment  worldwide. However  several vaccines are currently available that can  help to decrease the spread and severity of the pandemic  6 7 .   Corresponding author.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100934 2Despite the discovery of effective vaccines  the Ethiopian pop  ulations don t have enough access  due to a resource scarcity  6 . This  condition leads to the risk of illness  hospitalization  and death from the  virus. In response to this tricky situation  the Ethiopian government was  taking several preventive mechanisms to tackle the spread of the  COVID 19 pandemic  8 . Case identification  contact tracing  isolation   public gathering restrictions  travel restrictions  enforcement of face  mask mandates  health promotion using mass media  COVID 19 related  information seeking and sharing using digital technologies  and quar  antine for exposed persons were the main COVID 19 prevention efforts   6 9 . Moreover  the ministry of health MOH  in Ethiopia with the  collaboration of non governmental organizations NGOs  were made  significant efforts in developing the COVID 19 surveillance platform and  designing apps that do everything from virus tracing to sharing  COVID 19 related information  10 .  During the COVID 19 pandemic  information and communication  technologies  ICTs  were considered as a tool to track the spread and  share of health related information to make public awareness for  healthcare providers on reducing health problems  11 13 . It helps to  access high quality  cost effective healthcare service delivery by  increasing health professionals   communication  14 17 . This technol   ogy improves the skills to search  select  appraise  and apply online  health information  18 19 . These skills are known as digital health  literacy  20 .  On the other hand  a critical challenge affecting the successful roll   out and use of digital technology innovations in low income countries   LMICs   and sub Saharan Africa  SSA  in particular  are a reflection of  the political  social  and culture. In the response to COVID 19  the digital  divide was made even more obvious by the failure of information on  some of the proposed measures to reach intended audiences. This phe  nomenon increases socioeconomic disparities and health inequities   21 . Several challenges in mainstreaming digital health during the  COVID 19 pandemic are still observed. Before the crisis  targeted users  of health technology products in various parts of Africa were reluctant to  integrate the innovations into the healthcare system. This made social  distancing rules and other infection prevention control protocols in Af  rica including Ethiopia difficult to implement  22 24 .  During the time of COVID 19  managing the new cases and  decreasing the number of healthcare professionals and patients with  COVID 19 requires effective measures. Those measures include the  sharing of COVID 19 related information through digital technologies  among healthcare providers. This requires healthcare staff to be aware  of the concept of digital health and to have the respective skill to share  COVID 19 related information  25 .  However  literature shows digital health literacy to share COVID 19  related information was inadequate in developing countries. A study  conducted in Pakistan indicated that 54.3   26  and 45.7   27  and in  Iran 45.6   28  have low digital literacy to share health related infor  mation. In Ethiopia  digital health literacy was limited to sharing  health related information  29 . Additionally  most of the literature  conducted on digital health literacy was not specific to COVID 19   30 32 . Hence  we argue that a study that specifically assesses the  healthcare provider  s digital literacy to sharing of COVID 19 related  information is critical for addressing accurate and timely information  regarding COVID 19  31 33 34 .  Studies indicated that digital health literacy is influenced by  educational status  motivation toward using digital health solutions   frequent internet access  computer access  computer training  knowl   edge regarding the availability and importance of COVID 19 related  information  perceived usefulness  perceived ease of use  attitude to  wards digital health literacy  and smartphone access among respondents   29 31 32 35 38 .  In times of the pandemic  healthcare providers who worked in  COVID 19 treatment centers are front lines to share health information  about disease nature to fight against it  5 39 . Digital health literacy  may help to share relevant information regarding coronavirus disease prevention  control  and its sign and symptoms to their relatives  staff   and other health professionals in the healthcare organizations through  social media  cellphone conversation  text message  news media  email   and others  40 . Therefore  the study aimed to assess digital health lit  eracy to share COVID 19 related information and identify its associated  factors among healthcare providers who worked at the COVID 19  treatment center in the Amhara region  Northwest Ethiopia.  2.Methods  2.1. Study design  period  and area  The study was conducted an institutional based cross sectional sur  vey among healthcare providers who worked at COVID 19 treatment  centers in the Amhara region. The study was conducted from April 04 to  May 04  2021  in the Amhara region COVID 19 treatment center hos  pitals. Amhara region is located in the Northwestern and North Central  parts of Ethiopia. It has 85 hospitals  8 referral hospitals  20 general  hospitals  and 67 primary hospitals   862 health centers  and 10 private  hospitals  based on 2022 Amhara regional health bureau reports. It has  eleven COVID 19 treatment centers  such as Bahirdar Tibebe Gion   Bahirdar Felegehiwot  the University of Gondar  Debre tabor  Debre   Markos  Debre Birhan  Dessie  Fnote Selam  Woldya  Metema and  Sekota hospitals. Among those  the University of Gondar  and Bahirdar  Tibebe Gion are specialized teaching hospitals. Whereas  Bahirdar  Felegehiwot  Debre tabor  Debre Markos  Debre Birhan  Dessie  Fnote   Selam  and Woldya are specialized. Others are general hospitals.  2.2. Source and study populations  The source population was all healthcare providers who worked at  COVID 19 treatment centers in the Amhara region. Additionally  all  healthcare providers who worked in COVID 19 treatment centers at  those COVID 19 treatment center hospitals that were available during  the data collection period were study populations.  2.3. Inclusion and exclusion criteria  The inclusion criteria were all healthcare providers who worked in  COVID 19 treatment centers and permanent employees in the COVID 19  treatment center hospitals  who worked six months and above at hos  pitals. However  all healthcare providers were not available during the  data collection period due to some reasons. Such as illness  annual leave   and other cases were excluded from this study.  2.4. Sample size and sampling procedure  Sample size  n  was determined by single population proportion  formula by using p  50  because this study was new for a specific  disease. With Standard deviation  Z  2  1.96 for a 95  CI  and margin  of error  d  5  . With the formula   n  Z E2 2 P 1 P Ed2   n  1B96 2 0B50 1 0B50   0B05 2 384B16  A 10  non response rate was used. Accordingly  the total sample  size was 384B16 38B416 422B576 423Bwhereas  there wasn  t  much difference between the calculated sample size  423  and the total  number of the study population in the study setting  476 . Due to this   we have conducted an institutional based cross sectional survey among  healthcare providers who worked at COVID 19 treatment center hos  pitals in the Amhara region. We have taken lists and addresses of all  healthcare providers who worked in COVID 19 treatment centers  from  each health department administrative body. A.A.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100934 32.5. Data collection tool and procedure  To check the consistency and validity  a pretested and structured self   administered questionnaire was used to collect the data with all neces   sary precautions for COVID 19 prevention during the data collection  period. The tool was adapted and modified from different literature that  previously studded with related to digital health literacy to sharing of  COVID 19 related information  26 30 33 35 41 42 . Five data collectors   two data collectors were public health officers  two data collectors were  laboratory professionals and one data collector was an anesthesia pro  fessional  and two supervisors were participating in the data collection.  A total of 56 item questioners within three parts such as socio   demographic characteristics  individual characteristics  organizational  related characteristics  and digital health literacy to share COVID 19  related information. Pretest was conducted among 25 healthcare pro  viders  5  of the total sample size  at Felegehiwot specialized hospital  in a COVID 19 treatment center which was similar to our study setting.  The correctness  consistency  and quality of the questionnaire were  checked and seen in detail based on the pretest finding. The content  validity of the questionnaire was determined based on the view of ex  perts and the reliability was obtained by calculating the value of Cron  bach alpha  overall Cronbach alpha  0.89 .  2.6. Data processing and analysis  To ensure completeness and consistency of the data  first  we coded  and cleaned. Then  the data were entered by EpiData version 4.6 and  exported to SPSS 26 for further analysis. Summary statistics of socio   demographic variables were presented using frequency tables. Bi   variable logistic regression analysis was computed to control con  founding. All independent variables with P value less than 0.2 in Bi   variable logistic regression were entered into multivariable logistic  regression analysis. The strength of the association was described at 95   CI and the level of significance was determined at a P value of less than  0.05 for multivariable regression analysis model.  The fitness of the model was checked by using Hosmer and Leme   show test    2 DF  4.81  RMSEA  0.05  CFI  0.95  TLI  0.93 . A  multi collinearity test was conducted among the independent variables  and all of the variables scored variance inflation factors  VIF  of between  1.0 and 2.1. Most researchers considered a VIFD10 an indicator of  acceptable for multi collinearity  43 . Accordingly  our result showed  no correlation or moderate correlation between independent variables.  2.7. Measurements  2.7.1. Digital health literacy to share COVID 19 related knowledge  Defined as the level of technical knowledge to share COVID 19  related knowledge  information  and experiences with electronic re  sources. It was measured by nine closed ended Likert scale questions in  which ratings were made on a one to five scale where  1  strongly  disagree  2  disagree  3  neutral  4  agree  and 5  strongly agree.  Since digital literacy to share COVID 19 related knowledge was not  normally distributed  we computed the median score. Respondents who  scored with the median score and above were considered as they had a  good digital literacy level to share COVID 19 related knowledge. Re  spondents who scored below the median score were considered as they  had poor digital literacy levels to share COVID 19 related knowledge   26 27 30 .  2.7.2. Perceived easiness  Researchers argued that perceived ease of use is the extent to which a  person accepts as true that using an exacting technology would be at no  cost to that individual. It is the term that represents the degree to which  an innovation is perceived not to be difficult to understand  learn or  operate. It was measured by six closed end question items. Study par  ticipants who scored median and above the median in the five point Likert scale of Perceived easiness question were categorized they  thought eHealth was easy to use and those who scored below the median  were categorized they thought tele monitoring technologies as not easy  to use  44 .  2.7.3. Perceived usefulness  Perceived usefulness is the degree to which an individual  s percep   tion that using the new technology will enhance or improve her his  performance. It was measured by fourteen closed end question items.  Study participants who scored median and above the median in the five   point Likert scale of perceived usefulness question were categorized as  they thought ICT tools as useful for their patient management and those  who scored below the median were categorized as they thought ICT  tools as not useful for their patient management  44 .  2.7.4. Computer skill  It is referred to the abilities of healthcare providers which allow  using of computers and related technology. We used five items of Likert  scale questions to measure basic computer skills of the healthcare pro  viders which ranged from   1  strongly disagree to 5  strongly agree  .  Respondents who scored mean and above were considered as they had  good computer skills. Whereas respondents who scored below the mean  were considered as they had poor computer skills  45 46 .  2.7.5. Attitude toward digital health  In this study  an attitude refers to the feeling of healthcare providers  toward the introduction of digital health technologies. It was measured  by six items of Likert scale questions ranging from   1  strongly  disagree to 5  strongly agree  . Respondents who scored mean and  above were considered as they had a favorable attitude. Whereas re  spondents who scored below the mean were considered as they had  unfavorable attitudes  47 48 . The detail about the tools used for  measuring digital health literacy to share COVIS 19 related information  is found in Annex 1.  3.Results  3.1. Socio demographic characteristics  A total of 476  structured self administered questionnaires were  distributed to HCPs worked in COVID 19 treatment centers at Tibebe   Gion and the University of Gondar specialized and teaching referral  hospitals  among those  456 questionnaires were completed and  returned with a response rate of 95.8 . Based on the demographics and  other personal background information obtained  from the total re  spondents  338 74.1   of males  around half of respondents 225   49.3   were categorized under 21 30 years old  most of the re  spondents 353 77.4   were BSc degree holders  Table 1 .  3.2. Individual characteristics  From the total  254 55.7   of respondents had good computer skills   267 58.6   of respondents had a favorable attitude about digital liter  acy helps to share COVID 19 related information  191 41.9   of re  spondents said that digital literacy to share COVID 19 related  information were easy  212 46.5   of respondents said that digital lit  eracy to share COVID 19 related information were useful and 220   48.2   of the respondents had the good motivation towards digital  literacy level  Table 2 .  3.3. Organizational characteristics  From the total respondents  only 163 35.7   respondents were got  computer training opportunities. Among those  71 43.6   of re  spondents were gate training access at the workplace  58 35.6   of  respondents were gate training access at home  27  16.6   of A.A.

Among those  121 34.8   of respondents were gate internet access  at the workplace  62 17.8   of respondents were gate internet access at  home  140  40.2   of respondents were gate internet from both work   place and home and 26 7.2   respondents were at others places   Table 3 .  3.4. Digital health literacy to share COVID 19 related information  The result of this study showed that out of 456 study participants 230   50.4    95  CI  46 55  of healthcare providers who worked in COVID   19 treatment centers were at a high level in digital health literacy to  sharing of COVID 19 related information.  3.5. Factor associated with digital health literacy to share COVID 19  related information  All variables were entered into the binary logistic regression model.  From those variables  age  sex  educational status  professional cate  gories  salary  mobile phone types  computer training  computer access   internet access  attitude  perceived usefulness  motivation  and  perceived ease of use were factors associated with literacy to share  COVID 19 related information in the bi variable analysis at P value less  than 0.2. Due to this  those variables were subjected to the multivariable  logistic regression analysis to control potential confounders.  In the multivariate logistic regression analysis  respondents who  were master holders and above  AOR  4.37  95  CI 2.08  9.17    re  spondents who had computer training  AOR  3.00  95  CI   1.80  5.00    respondents who had favorite attitude  AOR  1.99  95   CI 1.18  3.36    respondents who said digital literacy to share COVID 19  related information were useful  AOR  2.01  95  CI 1.22  3.32    re  spondents who said digital literacy to share COVID 19 related infor  mation were easy  AOR  2.00  95  CI 1.25  3.21   and respondents  had smartphone access  AOR  5.21  95  CI 2.34  9.62   were signif   icantly associated with digital health literacy to sharing of COVID 19  related information at P value less than 0.05  Table 4 .  4.Discussion  The present study examined Digital health literacy to share COVID   19 related information and its associated factors in COVID 19 treat  ment centers of resource limited settings. The result of the study showed  that out of 456 study participants 230 50.4    95  CI  46 55  of  healthcare providers who worked in COVID 19 treatment centers were  at a high level in digital literacy to sharing of COVID 19 related  information.  This finding was consistent with the study conducted in Ethiopia  46.5   29   Pakistan 47.8   27   54.3   26   and Iran 54.4   28 .  However  this finding was less than the study conducted on Dutch  76     30 . This variation could be due to infrastructure  internet penetration   educational system difference among developing countries Ethiopia   and developed countries. But this finding is also lower than the study Table 1  Socio demographic characteristics of healthcare providers who worked at  COVID 19 treatment centers in Amhara region  North Ethiopia  2022.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100934 5conducted in northwest Ethiopia  which was  60    32  and  69.3     49 . The possible reason for this variation could be the study unit  the  study area  and the sample size between the previous study and this  study. In this regard  the studies conducted in Northwest Ethiopia were  focused on general digital health literacy but our study was specifically  on COVID 19. Therefore  the operational definition used in this study  has little difference from that of the previous one which could be the  other justification for this variation.  Whereas  this study finding was higher than the study conducted in  Korea 38.8   50 . This different result may be related to the difference  between study units of those studies. In our study  the participants were  healthcare providers who worked in COVID 19 treatment centers   whereas the previous study was conducted among nursing students. This  difference may be the main reason to gate different findings.  According to the result from multi variable regression analysis  the  odds of respondents who were masters and above holders were 4.37  times higher digital health literacy for sharing of COVID 19 related in  formation than that of respondents who were BSc and below holders.  This showed that the level of education increased  digital health literacy  also increase to share COVID 19 related information. When the levels of  educational status increase  awareness  and knowledge about digital  health literacy to share COVID 19 related information also increase. This  finding was supported by the study conducted in Ethiopia  29   the state  of Florida  33   and Pakistan  51 .  The odds of respondents who had smartphone access were 5.21 times  higher digital health literacy to share COVID 19 related information  than that of the respondents who had basic phone holders. This indi  cated that when the smartphone holder increases the respondent  s  knowledge and awareness about digital literacy for sharing of COVID 19  related information also increases. The reason could be due to if re  spondents have smartphones they could simply use important applica   tions that help to know digital technology playing on sharing of COVID   19 related information by exercising more  5 .  The odds of respondents who had a favorable attitude were 1.99  times higher digital health literacy to share COVID 19 related infor  mation than that of the respondents who had unfavorable attitudes. This  indicated that when the respondent  s attitude was favorable  the digital  health literacy to share COVID 19 related knowledge was high and vice  versa. This is because the respondents have a favorable attitude to know  digital health  they simply take actions on how to understand the digital  technology for applying to share COVID 19 related information. This  finding was supported by the study conducted in Ethiopia  29 49    Taylor and Francis  52  Korea  38 .  The odds of respondents who perceive digital tools as useful were  2.01 times higher in digital health literacy level than that of respondents  who perceive digital tools were not useful. This might be due to the  perceived benefit from using digital health tools enhanced healthcare  providers who worked in COVID 19 treatment centers   attitude which  ultimately leads sustainably practicing to use it. This is consistent with a  previous study conducted in Northwest Ethiopia  32 .  Respondents who perceived using digital health tools as easy were  2.00 times more likely to have a higher digital health literacy level than  that of respondents who perceived digital health tools as not easy.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100934 6main justification could be since healthcare providers who worked in  COVID 19 treatment centers who consider using digital tools easy were  more confident in practicing and building their literacy and it is known  that perceived ease of use could be influencing respondents  acceptance  of digital health information technologies  53 . This is in line with the  studies conducted in Ref.  53 .  The odds of respondents who gate computer training were 3.00 times  more likely digital health literate than that of respondents who were not  gated computer training access. This indicated that if respondents have  computer training access at the workplace  home  both workplace and  home and also others place were good awareness about digital health  literacy.  5.Conclusion  This finding indicated that approximately half of the respondents  had digital health literacy to share COVID 19 related information which  was inadequate. Educational status  computer training  introducing  smartphone technology  perceived usefulness  perceived ease of use  and  creating awareness about the importance of digital health literacy for  COVID 19 related information sharing were factors to be significantly  associated with digital health literacy to share COVID 19 related infor  mation among healthcare providers worked in COVID 19 treatment  centers.  6.Strengths and limitations of the study  This study was the first study in Ethiopia assessing digital health  literacy specifically on COVID 19 related information sharing. However   it was conducted only at two teaching referral hospitals in the Amhara  region which might be lower its generalizability to the other treatment  centers. This study shares the limitation of cross sectional studies.  Therefore  it might not provide a strong cause effect relationship.  Additionally  this study wasn t supported by qualitative findings. The  comparison of the study was made with limitation since the study spe  cifically assess COVID 19 was lacking.  7.Recommendations  Considering digital health solutions are vital for tackling the COVID   19 pandemic  the MOH shall provide computer training in collaboration  with NGOs. This will help healthcare providers to easily share and  communicate COVID 19 related information for evidence based deci  sion making. In collaboration with other concerned bodies  the MOH  shall stress creating awareness about the importance of adopting digital  health technologies.  Furthermore  the government shall increase healthcare pro  fessionals  level of confidence to use digital technologies. Additionally   the government shall encourage healthcare professionals to use tech  nologies for health information sharing and create health promotion  activities through these technologies to save the life of individuals.  Healthcare providers are recommended to introduce smartphone tech  nology. It is also important for future researchers to consider exploring  digital health literacy with qualitative findings. Additionally  this study  needs further investigation to increase the consistency of the finding.
