Although the reported outcomes are very high in most cases  these results were obtained without an independent test set from a separate data source s . DL models are likely to overfit training data distribution when independent test sets are not utilized or are prone to learn dataset specific artifacts rather than the actual disease characteristics and underlying pathology. This study aims to assess the promise of such DL methods and datasets by investigating the key challenges and issues by examining the compositions of the available public image datasets and designing different experimental setups. A convolutional neural network based network  called CVR Net  COVID 19 Recognition Network   has been proposed for conducting comprehensive experiments to validate our hypothesis. The presented end to end CVR Net is a multi scale  multi encoder ensemble model that aggregates the outputs from two different encoders and their different scales to convey the final prediction probability. Three different classification tasks  such as 2   3   4 classes  are designed where the train test datasets are from the single  multiple  and independent sources. The obtained binary classification accuracy is 99.8  for a single train test data source  where the accuracies fall to 98.4  and 88.7  when multiple and independent train test data sources are utilized. Similar outcomes are noticed in multi class categorization tasks for single  multiple  and independent data sources  highlighting the challenges in developing DL models with the existing public datasets without an independent test set from a separate dataset. Such a result concludes a requirement for a better designed dataset for developing DL tools applicable in actual clinical settings. The dataset should have an independent test set  for a single machine or hospital source  have a more balanced set of images for all the prediction classes  and have a balanced dataset from several hospitals and demography. Our source codes and model are publicly available1for the research community for further improvements. 1. Introduction Pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan  China  was re  ported to the World Health Organization  WHO  office in China on 31st December 2019. This was subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS CoV 2  on 11th February 2020  as the virus causing the disease is genetically related to the coronavirus re  sponsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003. The new disease was referred to as   COVID 19   by WHO on 11th February 2020   1 . As of August  Correspondence to  Department of EEE  KUET  Khulna 9203  Bangladesh.

A world heat map of the corona pandemic per capita   9   Accessed on 25 December 2021 . and time consuming procedure with an estimated true positive rate of 63.0    6 . There is a significant lack of inventory of RT PCR kits  leading to a delay in efforts to prevent and cure coronavirus disease   7 . Furthermore  the RT PCR kit is estimated to cost around 120   130 USD and requires a specially designed biosafety laboratory to house the PCR unit  each of which can cost 15 000   90 000USD   8 . Nevertheless  the utilization of a costly screening device with delayed test results makes it more challenging to suppress the spread of the disease. However  it is observed that most of the COVID  19cases have common characteristics on radiographic images  such as Computed Tomography  CT  and Chest X ray  CXR   including bilateral  multi  focal  ground glass opacities with a peripheral or posterior distribution  mainly in the lower lobes and early  and late stage pulmonary consol  idation   10 13 . Those features can be utilized to develop a sensitive Computer aided Diagnosis  CAD  tool to detect COVID  19Pneumonia and be considered as a screening tool   14 . Currently  deep Convo  lutional Neural Networks  CNNs  allow for building an end to end model  without the need for manual feature extraction   15 16   which have demonstrated tremendous success in many domains of medical imaging  such as arrhythmia detection   17 19   skin lesion segmenta  tion and classification   20 24   breast cancer detection   25 27   brain disease classification   28   pneumonia detection from CXR images   29   fundus image segmentation   30 31   minimally invasive surgery   32  and lung segmentation   33 . Several deep CNN based methods have been published to detect COVID 19 from CXR and CT images. Though the results obtained are promising  they exhibit limited scope as a CAD tool. Most of the works  especially on CXR images  have been based on data from different sources for two different classes  COVID vs. Normal . This brings inherent bias on the algorithms as the model tends to learn the distribution and artifacts of the data source for binary classification problems. Therefore  these models perform very poorly when used in practical settings where the model has to adapt to data from different domains. To accelerate the development of DL tools that could be utilized in realistic clinical settings  the scientific community needs to emphasize more on making publicly systematically designed and documented datasets that have information  such as inclusion and exclusion criteria  symptomatic vs. asymptomatic cases  and the disease severity stage at which these images were taken. In this work  we design various experiments with a proposed CNN based COVID 19 detection method to justify this proposition. The rest of the paper is structured as follows  Section 2 reviews the earlier published literature for COVID 19 detection  and Section 3 highlights the significant contributions to this article. We explain the proposed framework for the recognition of COVID 19 and datasets in Section 4. The results and different experiments are reported inSection 5. We interpret the obtained results from the proposed CVR  Net in Section 6. Finally  Section 7 concludes the article with future working directions. 2. Review of literature Different CNN architectures have already been proposed for COVID  19 detection as a binary  COVID vs. No Findings  or multi class  COVID vs. No Findings vs. Pneumonia  problem   34 36 . Ghoshal and Tucker  37  investigated uncertainty of the COVID 19 classification report  us  ing a drop weights based Bayesian CNN  as the availability of uncertainty aware DL can ensure more extensive adoption of DL in clin  ical applications. Abbas et al.   38  proposed a framework by adopting a deep CNN  called Decompose  Transfer  and Compose  DeTraC    39  for the classification of COVID  19CXR images  where the authors implemented the DeTraC in two phases. Firstly  using gradient descent optimization  they trained the backbone pre trained CNN model of DeTraC to extract deep local features from each image. Secondly  they used the class composition layer of DeTraC to refine the final classi  fication of the images. Zhao et al.   40  developed diagnosis methods based on multi task learning and self supervised learning  where the authors proposed an open source COVID 19 dataset of CT images with a binary class  COVID and Non COVID . For the classification task  they trained DenseNet  169and ResNet  50  via a pre trained model on ImageNet   16  weights  with their newly proposed dataset. Afshar et al.  41  proposed a CNN model named COVID CAPS  which was based on the Capsule Networks  CapsNets  for handling the small datasets of COVID 19. CapsNets are alternative models of CNN  which are capable of capturing spatial information using routing by agreement. Capsules try to reach a mutual agreement on the existence of the objects. Their proposed COVID CAPS model had 4convolutional layers and 3capsule layers  where batch normalization   42  followed the former layers. The authors fine tuned all the capsule layers  while the conventional layers were frozen with pre trained weights of ImageNet. He et al.   43  built a COVID 19 CT dataset  called China Consortium of Chest CT Image Investigation  CC CCII   with three classes  novel coronavirus Pneumonia  common Pneumonia  and healthy controls. The authors trained 3D DenseNet3D  121on their proposed CC CCII dataset  and they experimentally validated that 3D CNNs outperform 2D CNNs in general. Singh et al.   13  implemented a CNN based model named multi objective differential evolution based CNN for the classification of COVID  19. They fine tuned the parameters of the CNN model using a multi objective fitness function. The differential evolution algorithm was used to optimize the multi objective fitness function. The model was optimized iteratively using mutation  crossover  and selection oper  ation to determine the best available solution in differential evolution.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100945 3M.K. Hasan et al. Farooq and Hafeez  44  employed ResNet  50using transfer learning with progressively resizing  45  the input images to 128  128  3  224  224  3  and 229  229  3 pixels  where the authors also fine tuned the network at each stage. Ozkaya et al.  46  extracted deep features using VGG  16  GoogleNet  47   and ResNet  50models  which were classified by Support Vector Machine  SVM   48  with linear kernel function. They also applied the modified T test  49   a feature ranking algorithm  to select the features  50  for avoiding overfitting. Rajaraman et al.  51  evaluated ImageNet pre trained CNN models such as VGG  16  VGG  19  InceptionV 3  Xception  Inception  ResNetV 2  MobileNetV 2  DenseNet  201  and NasNet mobile  52 . Then  they optimized the hyperparameters of the CNNs using a randomized grid search method  53 . In the end  the authors proposed an ensemble of those CNN models for the final COVID 19 recognition. To a ar et al.  54  restructured the data classes using a fuzzy color technique  where they stacked a structured image with the original images. The authors trained MobileNetV 2and SqueezeNet to extract the deep fea  tures  which were then processed using the social mimic optimization method  55 . After that  selected features were combined and classified using the SVM to recognize COVID 19. Khan et al.  56  developed a 15 layered CNN architecture for extracting deep features from two different layers like global average pool and fully connected layers  which were then merged employing the max layer detail approach. The most discriminant features from the pool of features were selected using a Correntropy technique  and a one class kernel extreme learning machine classifier was applied for the classification. CNN based models like ResNet50  ResNet101  ResNet152  InceptionV3  and Inception  ResNetV2 were proposed and implemented by Narin et al.  57  for the detection of COVID 19 infected patient using CXR radiographs. Sedik et al.  58  classified CT and CXR images of COVID 19 vs. normal using CNN and convolutional long short term memory  ConvLSTM  based models. Sanida et al.  59  employed lightweight modified MobileNetV2 to classify the COVID 19  normal  viral Pneumonia  and lung opacity images for the real time operations in a low power embedded sys  tem. Authors in  60  proposed a COVIDetectioNet using a pre trained AlexNet to extract the deep features. The useful features were selected using the Relief algorithm from all layers of the architecture were then classified using the SVM approach. An efficient Grayscale Spatial Exploitation Net  GSEN  is designed by employing web pages crawling across cloud computing environments in  61   utilizing the accuracy rates improvement in a positive relationship to the cardinality of crawled CXR dataset. Their model consists of four convolutional blocks where each is composed of a single convolutional  batch normalization  ReLU activation function  and max pooling layer. Monday et al.  62  proposed a neurowavelet capsule network. Firstly  they presented a multi resolution analysis of a discrete wavelet transform to filter noisy and incompatible information from the CXR data to enhance the feature extraction robustness of the network. Secondly  the discrete wavelet transform of the multi resolution analysis was also conducted a sub  sampling procedure to minimize the loss of spatial details  thereby improving the overall classification performance. Sakthivel et al.  63  proposed an ensemble based CNN model where five DL models like ResNet  FitNet  IRCNN  MobileNet  and EfficientNet are ensembled and fine tuned to classify the CXR images. An application specific hardware architecture had been incorporated by carefully exploiting the data flow and resource availability. 3. Our contributions Many DL based Artificial Intelligence  AI  algorithms have been proposed in the past year to automatically classify COVID 19 cases from normal and other Pneumonia cases. These published works reported high COVID 19 binary classification accuracy using either CT scans or CXRs  13 34 35 45 54 64 71 . Although the reported metrics  such as sensitivity and or specificity  are very high in most cases  these results are obtained on cross validation studies without an independent test setcoming from a separate dataset having biases  such as the two classes predicted from two unique datasets. AI models are likely to overfit training data distribution when independent test sets are not used or are prone to learn dataset specific artifacts rather than the actual disease characteristics. Additionally  the publicly available datasets for COVID 19 classification used in the recent studies have class and dataset source biases  resulting in AI models learning dataset specific distributions rather than the underlying pathology. Many recent studies proposing COVID 19 classification based on DL using imaging data do not emphasize the importance of avoiding overfitting and having an independent test set with images from a separate dataset than the training and validation dataset. However  the critical contributions in this article are pointed out as follows   Proposing an end to end and multi scale multi encoder CVR Net  aggregating the outputs from two different encoders and their different scales to obtain the final prediction probability.  Designing various experiments to investigate the issues of over  fitting and biasing  exploring the limitations of existing large public datasets that have been widely used for developing and evaluating COVID 19 detection algorithms in the past years.  Validating multi class classification models to distinguish various Pneumonia types  including COVID 19  requires a balanced set of images for all the prediction classes coming from a single site and demography and having several balanced sets coming from separate scanners or hospitals and demography.  Comparing the proposed architecture to other state of the art methods using an independent test set for evaluation  where some of the identified bias and overfitting issues are minimized. 4. Materials and methods This section presents the materials and methods for conducting this research. Section 4.1 briefly describes utilized datasets. The designing of the proposed network  CVR Net  is explained in Section 4.2. Finally  Section 4.3 describes the training protocol of our network and the evaluation metrics. 4.1. Datasets This section illustrates the experimental setup for various classi  fication tasks utilizing chest CT scans or CXRs from several publicly available datasets. The classes applied for different experimentations are taken from the following set   NOR  Normal  no Pneumonia and COVID 19 negative  CVP  COVID 19 positive Pneumonia  OVP  Other Viral Pneumonia  Viral Pneumonia but not COVID 19  OBP  Other Bacterial Pneumonia  Bacteria induced Non COVID Pneumonia  NCP  Non COVID Pneumonia  OBP   OVP  NCV  Non COVID  NOR   NCP Table 1 demonstrates the details of the experimental setup with various tasks and how various datasets are combined for these tasks. Three different types of classification tasks are designed  NCV vs. CVP  2 classes  CL2   NOR vs. NCP vs. CVP  3 classes  CL3   and NOR vs. OBP vs. OVP vs. CVP  4 classes  CL4 . Several different combinations of the publicly available datasets are utilized for chest CT scans  labeled CT  and for chest X rays  labeled CXR   40 71 79 . For each binary  CL2  or multi class  CL3 CL4  classification task  we design experiments to study the impact of having single separate vs. multiple mixed sources of data for individual classes during training  labeled Single and Multiple   respectively. The setup where the test set contains images from an independent source whose images are never used during training and validation is labeled as Independent . For adding diversity in each class of CXR Multiple CL2   we include images from more datasets  CXR images

To evaluate the ability to distinguish various Pneumonia types  we design CXR Multiple CL3 and CXR Multiple CL4 having the same number of images as CXR Multiple CL2   but the NCV class split into individual Pneumonia types. Similar to CXR  publicly available CT scan datasets are also utilized  where most of these datasets contained manually selected 2D slices instead of complete 3D volumes. Hence  all of the CT images referred to in this paper are 2D slices of CT scans. CT Single CL2 utilizes NCV and CVP samples from SCoV  78   while we have multiple sources to each class in CT Multiple CL2 adding NCV and CVP samples from MGC  40   SCoV  78   and CCII  71 . Due to a lack of publicly available images  some of the designs were not possible  for example  CT Multiple  CL3andCT Multiple CL4 . To evaluate the network s performance on an independent test set from a separate dataset source whose images are never used during the network s training  we design CXR Independent  CL2and CT Independent CL2   utilizing train data from a large study in Spain and test data from the other sources. Table 1 details the train test split for these two setups. Fig. 2 shows example images from these datasets. In the setup where an independent test dataset is not available  5 fold cross validation is applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed CVR Net  see in Section 4.2 . 4.2. Proposed CVR Net Architecture We propose a CNN based end to end multi tasking network  where we apply multi encoder and multi scale ensembling  as depicted in Fig. 3. The proposed CVR Net consists of two encoders  for the same input image  where each of the encoders has five blocks  namely  1  and 2     1 2   5  for encoder  1and encoder  2  respectively. The encoder 1 consists of the residual and convolutional blocks  81   as presented in Fig. 4  well known as ResNet  81 . The residual connec  tions  also known as skip connections  allow gradients to flow through a network directly  without passing through non linear activation func  tions and thus avoiding the problem of vanishing gradients  81 . In residual connections  the output of a weight layer series is added to the original input and then passed through the non linear activation function  as shown in Fig. 4. However  in encoder  1  7 7 inputconvolution  followed by max pooling with the stride of 2  and pool size of 3  3  is used before identity and convolutional blocks. By stacking these blocks on top of each other  see Fig. 3   an encoder  1is formed to get the feature map  where the notation       under the identity block denotes the number of repetitions    times . The different blocks of encoder  1  1 and   1 2   5  downsample the input image resolutions in half of the input resolutions  while the resolution inside the blocks is kept constant. The outputs of those blocks generate the feature maps with different scales. Within the encoder  2 Xception   three components of information flow blocks are used  which were initially proposed by Chollet  82   such as entry flow  middle flow  and exit flow  as depicted in Fig. 3. The batch of input images first passes through the input flow  then the central flow  eight times   8   repeated  and finally through the exit flow. All flows  as in the proposed network  see in Fig. 3   have Depth wise Separable Convolution  DwSC   82  and residual connections. As in the case of encoder  1  the resolution after each block is downsampled by the factor of two  and the exact resolution is maintained at each block for encoder  2. After the two encoder blocks  the two different 2D feature maps are concatenated channel wise to enhance the depth information of the feature map. We use differently scaled feature maps to build the proposed CVR Net  where each feature map is passed through the Fully Connected Layer  FCL  block. A Global Average Pooling  GAP   83  layer and four fully connected layers are used in our FCL block  where the GAP layer performs an extreme dimensionality reduction to avoid overfitting. In GAP  an                       dimensional tensor is reduced to a 1   1        vector by transferring               feature map to a single number contributes to the lightweight design of the proposed CVR Net. Table 2 presents the implementational details of the proposed CVR Net. We utilize the feature maps  13  15from encoder  1and 23  25from encoder  2  where we concatenate  15 and 25to increase the depth of the feature information. The final prediction  in CVR Net  is the average of different probabilities  such as 1  2  3  4  and 5respectively for  13  14   15    25   23  and 24  which was trained end to end fashion. However  designing of such a multi encoder and multi scale network  as CVR Net  has several benefits  especially for the small datasets  such as  if one encoder fails to

Another positive prospect of the CVR Net is that during the training  it can be anticipated that if the gradient of one or more branches vanishes  other branches can recover it as the final gradient is the average of all the individual gradients.4.3. Training protocol and evaluation Since most images in all the datasets have a 1   1 aspect ratio  we resize the images to 224  224 pixels using nearest neighbor interpola  tion. We apply the following stochastic augmentation on the resized images with  rotation  with a probability of 0.45   height   width shift  with a probability of 0.20   and vertical   horizontal flipping around the X  and   axis  with a probability of 1.0   respectively. We employ categorical cross entropy as a loss function   84   penalizing

Each class s weights are computed as          where  and  are the weights  and the total number of samples for the  th class and  is the total sample numbers. The network weights are initialized using transfer learning   85  where we use the ImageNet pre trained weights of ResNet 50 and Xception to initialize the weights of the two respective branches. We use Adam optimizer to optimize the training network with initial learning rate       exponential decay rates    1   2  as    0.0001  1  0.9  and  2  0.999  respectively  without AMSGrad variant   86 . The initial learning rate is reduced after 12epochs by 10.0  if validation loss stops improving. The training is terminated after 25epochs if the validation performance stops improving. The models were implemented using the Python programming lan  guage and Keras framework   87  and the experiments were carried out on a machine running Windows 10 operating system with the following hardware configuration  Intel CoreTMi7   7700 HQ CPU   3.60 GHz processor with Install memory  RAM   32.0 GB and GeForce GTX 1080 GPU with 8 GB memory. When comparing against other state of the  art methods  see in Table 5   the same above described protocol was operated for all the networks. We use different metrics  such as recall  precision  F1 score  and accuracy  to evaluate our multi tasking CVR Net for COVID 19 recog  nition  which is mathematically defined   88  as follows                                        1         2     2                                       where the TP  FN  FP  and TN respectively denote true positive  pa  tient with coronavirus symptoms recognized as the positive patient   false negative  patient with coronavirus symptoms recognized as the negative patient   false positive  patient without coronavirus symptomsrecognized as the positive patient   and true negative  patient without coronavirus symptoms recognized as the negative patient .

Experimental results This section initially presents the results of binary and multi class classification tasks for various setups described in Section 4.1 using the architecture proposed in Section 4.2. Finally  we compare the proposed network s performance with state of the art classification networks by training them on the same training set and evaluating an independent test set whose images are not used during training. 5.1. Binary classification  COVID vs. Non COVID Table 3 presents the quantitative results of the proposed CVR Net on the binary task  COVID 19  CVP  vs. Non COVID  NCV . The 5  fold cross validation results are conveyed with average and standard deviation. In contrast  a single value is reported when a separate test set from an independent data source is used to evaluate the results. Table 3 demonstrates very high precision and recall in both the cases of CXR Single CL2 and CXR Multiple CL2. A slight reduction in accuracy for CXR Multiple CL2 compared to CXR Single CL2 may be because of relatively more minor overfitting to the distribution of the single particular dataset from which the individual classes were coming from in CXR Single CL2. As expected  the results for CXR Independent CL2 show reduced precision and recall  with accuracy dropping from 98   99  in the cross validation results to around 88   when using an independent test set. The observations in the experiments with CXR are consistent in CT as well. Table 3 shows the same pattern with CT  Single CL2 and CT Multiple CL2 having very high accuracy compared

The cross validation results reflect the large DL models  overfitting nature on a relatively small dataset with limited variability of the real world scenarios. The accuracy in CT Independent  CL2 drops from 87   96  in the cross validation results to around 79  when using the independent test set. We also notice that the accuracy with CT is lower than CXR. 5.2. Multi class classifications  Normal  COVID  other bacterial  and viral pneumonia Table 4 and Fig. 5 present quantitative results of the proposed CVR  Net on two different multi class tasks   i  3 class problem for NOR vs. NCP vs. CVP  ii  4 class problem for NOR vs. OBP vs. OVP vs. CVP. Similar to the binary classification  cross validation results are reported with average and standard deviation. Fig. 5 shows that in CXR Single CL3  NOR and NCP rarely get predicted as CVP while a small number of CVP gets predicted as NCP and NOR. Compared to CVP  a higher fraction of NOR gets predicted as NCP. This is perhaps because the NOR and NCP classes come from the same dataset source  while CVP images are from separate sources. We see that in CXR  Multiple CL3  fractions of NOR and CVP getting predicted as NCP are much closer. It is worth noting that NOR and NCP in CXR Multiple  CL3 have images coming from two different datasets  but these sources still do not have the CVP images coming from separate sources. It can also be observed that adding multiple data sources in NOR and NCP has substantially increased the fraction of NCP being predicted asNOR in CXR Multiple CL3. From Tables 3 and 4  we see that inter fold variation is increasing with the decreased performance metrics when a new class is added with the same number of total samples when comparing CXR Single CL2 vs. CXR Single CL3 and CXR Multiple CL2 vs. CXR Multiple CL3. In CXR Multiple CL4  NCP is further split into other bacterial and viral Pneumonia  OBP and OVP. As seen in Fig. 5  the network confuses much more between OBP and OVP  both coming from the same dataset CXRI. Following the pattern of CXR Single  CL3  we can also observe that nearly 14  of OBP and OVP still gets classified as NOR. CVP has relatively high precision and recall  but it is noteworthy that the source of the CVP images and the rest of the three classes do not intersect. These results further reinforce the observation in the binary classification task that seemingly high accuracy could be due to the network learning bias in the dataset design and peculiarities of individual data sources rather than the actual underlying pathology. Unlike binary classification problems  we could not evaluate with an independent test set and perform the experiments with CT scans due to the lack of publicly available datasets for these multiple classes. 5.3. Comparison to the state of the art Several recent studies report the DL models  performance using datasets that are not publicly available  89 91 . However  we compare these methods utilizing publicly available data using the experimental setup CXR Independent CL2 and CT Independent CL2  i.e.  the setup  where test set images coming from an independent dataset whose

Table 5 manifests the performance of the proposed CVR Net along with other widely used and state of the art classification networks and COVID 19 detection networks. The hyperparameters for all the networks used in Table 5  such as learning rate  regularizations  number of epochs  optimization algorithm  etc.  are described in Section 4.3 at the end. The proposed CVR Net performs the best concerning the precision  recall  and overall accuracy in CXR and CT images. The second best is Inception v3 for CXR and VGG 19 for CT scan. Fig. 6 visualizes the regions in the input image where the neural network is activating most of its signalfrom when predicting COVID 19 positive class. The activation maps are shown using GradCAM with a threshold 0.6  maximum 1   92 . In the figure  the input images are the top three true positive images for CXR and CT  having the highest softmax prediction output for the COVID 19 class from CVR Net. The activation map for CVR Net as a whole is smooth and focused within the lung region  while the two branches of CVR Net having ResNet and Xception architecture have more dispersed activation maps outside the lung region as well. This reveals that combining the two branches make the activation map more focused on the lung region. However  it is remarkably noticed that the

For Inception  the activation maps are dispersed and smooth  but it is important to note that the images were chosen based on the highest confidence in predicting COVID 19 for CVR Net and not for Inception. 6. Discussion and observations We have studied the issues and challenges of DL methods on pub  licly available datasets for COVID 19 detection using CXRs and CT scans in this work. The results show that many current DL based methods for COVID 19 classification over estimate their performance. In particular  we observed two significant issues leading to such high accuracy that is likely not to translate to real world settings   i  the prediction classes training data come from separate individual dataset sources. This can result in the network learning the peculiarities of the dataset from which the particular class comes rather than the under  lying pathology s characteristics or features.  ii  the cross validation results without an independent test set whose images are never used during training can overestimate the network s performance. It is im  portant to note that both the mentioned issues are common knowledge in machine learning but seems to have been overlooked or not em  phasized enough in many recent works involving DL and COVID 19 detection   13 34 36 65 80 93 94 . To reduce such bias and overfitting problems to some extent  we have designed an experiment where the training set contains images in each class from various dataset sources  and an independent test set is used to evaluate the deep neural networks. The results show that  as expected  the performance of the DL model reduces in this scenario. In this more realistic setting  CVR Net performed the best when compared against other state of the art classification networks. CVR Net  architecture detailed in Section 4.2  uses multiple branches and aggregates information from different scales  creating a form of ensembling within a single network that seems to be more robust than other DL models  such as VGG  Xception  ResNet  Inception  DenseNet  and EfficientNet  as seen in Table 5. While some of the hyperparam  eters  such as learning rate and epochs  are adapted for each model dynamically during training  we did not exhaustively optimize the hyperparameters  regularization methods  and training protocol for each of the models separately  details in Section 4.2 . For a more detailed comparison  these networks require extensive experimentation with each model to separately tune the hyperparameters and select the best regularization methods outside the scope and objective of the current paper. 4 class classification task showed the model s difficulty distinguish  ing bacterial Pneumonia from other viral Pneumonia. Although the results in Fig. 5 for CXR Multiple CL4 suggest that COVID 19 Pneumo  nia is well distinguished from other Pneumonia  the underlying reasonis likely that these two classes come from separate data sources. To evaluate the model s ability to distinguish different classes properly  we suggest that it is essential to have images for each class coming from the same settings  such as the same imaging protocol  machines  demography  etc. Images from multiple settings should also be included when the objective is to assess the algorithm s ability to work in diverse settings. However  it is essential to include images from all these settings in each class in this case. Table 5 shows higher accuracy when using CXR images compared to CT. We utilized 2D slices rather than the whole CT volume  which was not publicly available for most experimental setups. CT volume may capture details of 3D spatial information  potentially missed in these 2D slices manually selected. Thus  we cannot conclude from the results that CXR is more sensitive than CT for COVID 19 diagnosis. Moreover  the publicly available datasets come from many different sources where it is challenging to track inclusion and exclusion criteria  symptomatic vs. asymptomatic cases  and the disease severity stage at which these images were taken. Building a dataset containing these details may help identify the sensitivity of CXR vs. CT at different stages and symptom severity. This might facilitate a more informed decision for deciding between CT and CXR  which has several tradeoffs  such as patient conditions and the availability of the resource   95 96 . 7. Conclusion This paper has explored the insights of the COVID 19 detection using the DL framework and publicly available datasets. An end to  end DL based model  called CVR Net  recognizes the COVID 19 from chest radiography images with fewer false negatives. The multi scale  multi encoder design of the CVR Net ensures robustness in recognition  as the final prediction probability is the aggregation of multiple scales and encoders. The experimental results show that many DL based meth  ods overestimate their interpretation as the data come from different individual dataset references and the cross validation results without an independent test set. The training set from diverse sources and an independent test set can ameliorate such bias and overfitting troubles to some extent. It is also observed and suggested that it is necessary to have images for each class from identical settings like imaging protocol  machines  and demography. The results also reveal that the CXRs exhibit higher accuracy when compared to CT. We utilized 2D slices rather than the whole CT volume  unavailable for most experimental se  tups. CT volume may capture 3D spatial information  potentially missed in these manually selected 2D slices. However  the CXRs images can be a good choice for COVID 19 recognition as it has better performance in our experimentation  especially where CT is unavailable to collect. It can be remarked and concluded from the experiments that to accelerate the development of practical clinical DL tools  the scientific community needs to emphasize more on making publicly systematically designed and documented datasets that have information  such as inclusion and

Future work will improve the performance by segmenting the lung and adding more distinctive training samples to all the classes. We also intend to deploy our trained CVR Net to a web application for clinical utilization.
