For this purpose gene expression profiles of patients is analysed in an unsupervised manner followed by determining the clinical relevance of the subtypes discovered. However  high dimensional nature of omics data leads to  curse of dimensionality  and results in overlapping subtypes with regard to subtype specific survival curves. None of the methods guarantee separability of patients with respect to subtype specific survival curves. Methods  We propose a robust framework for clustering cancer patients into molecular subtypes by leveraging gene expression data. The framework is based on UMAP and an adaptive to noise robust clustering method OTRIMLE. Survival analysis is performed for the discovered subtypes  and the clustering solution that maximizes the Restricted Life Expectancy difference  RLED  between survival curves for each subtype is chosen. Results  The resulting framework is tested on five datasets of cancer obtained from TCGA  and the results are evaluated by comparing with Neighbourhood based multi omics  NEMO   Similarity Network Fusion  SNF  and Consensus Clustering  CC . Comparisons show that the proposed framework achieved better separation of subtype specific survival curves. For instance  the minimum separation achieved between any two subtypes for GLIO is 94 days for the proposed framework  while it is about 57  62 and 38 days respectively for NEMO  SNF and CC. Further  over representation analysis for each subtype is performed to identify significantly over represented pathways which can be potential treatment targets. Conclusion  The results advocate that our approach is able to discover subtypes that have better separability in terms of survival  and its significance lies in reducing uncertainty in patient s expected outcome. 1. Introduction Diseases  like cancer  diabetes and autism have poor treatment outcome due to the high degree of phenotypic as well as genotypic vari  ation among the affected individuals   1 . Precision medication aims to solve this problem by tailoring the medical care to the individual char  acteristic of each patient   2 . Subtyping of diseases plays a dominant role in precision medicine  it involves allocating individuals suffering from seemingly the same disease into homogeneous sub populations  supposedly sharing similar clinical and molecular characteristics   3 4 . Subtyping of patients  in turn  translates to better therapeutic and prog  nostic options for the treatment of cancer. Watson for Medicine  WFO   a super computer from IBM corporation for precision medication   5   although still under clinical trial  is emerging to be a useful artificial intelligence tool for clinical oncology to guide the treatment regimen process for specific types of cancers and has successfully been used in countries like United states and Japan   6 .

Rather .Recent advances in high throughput technologies have made it sim  ple and cost effective to gather different omics profiles from patients. This data  in turn is explored for studying the molecular basis of diseases   7 8 . Meanwhile  numerous machine learning and statistical techniques such as non negative matrix factorization  consensus clus  tering  hierarchical clustering have been tailored to discover disease subtypes that better correlate with clinical outcomes than traditional classification methods   9 13 . The authors in   14  highlight the im  portance of consensus clustering based methods over non consensus techniques on the transcriptomic data for patient subtyping. Also  several methods that integrate multi omics data such as miRNA  methylation or copy number variation for the same cohort have been developed to discover cancer subtypes. SNF   15  is an example of one such method. SNF starts with building a similar network of patients for each omic. Each of these networks is then clubbed into a single network that represents the combined effect of all omics datasets. https   doi.org 10.1016 j.imu.2022.100907 Received 25 December 2021  Received in revised form 14 February 2022  Accepted 6 March 2022

Rather and M.A. Chachoo Finally  spectral clustering  16 17  is applied on the resultant eigen vec  tors of graph to discover clinically relevant sub groups. Neighbourhood based Multi Omics  NEMO   18  is an extension of SNF  but in addition to working on complete datasets  it also works on partial datasets. However  all these methods fail to guarantee the separability of patients with respect to subtype specific Kaplan Meier plots. Recently  SBC  19  tries to solve the above problem  by performing a joint analysis on the survival data together with gene expression data and employs a semi supervised approach. An Accelerated Failure Time  AFT  is used to point out features that correlate better with survival data. However  SBC is designed to work with only the relevant genes  not more than 70 . Gene expression data  however  poses several challenges owing to its high dimensional nature and the inherent noise present in the data. The gene expression matrix contains a huge number of genes  thousands  obtained from a select few affected individuals. This sheer number of variables obtained from a single sample is referred to as  curse of dimensionality  and manifests in several ways. Firstly  as the dimensionality  of the data increases  the volume occupied by samples also grows rapidly  and thus any given neighbourhood of the space more likely become sparse. Secondly  with increase in dimensionality  the differences of distances from a data point to its closest and farthest neighbours becomes indistinguishable and are roughly the same. As a result  distance metrics like Euclidean and Minkowski tend to lose their significance in high dimensional space  20 21 . Thirdly  with         the range of correlations between data points drops rapidly. Therefore  clustering techniques that rely on such similarity measures work poorly with high dimensional data. Numerous dimensional reduction techniques have been considered to circumvent the issues mentioned above. For example  PCA has suc  cessfully been used to classify breast  colon  high grade gliomas  lung cancers  22 23  from gene expression data. However  PCA does not provide much attention on the local geometric properties of data and is therefore unable to extract the non linear relations between genes. Moreover  PCA relies on covariance matrix and in high dimensional space the sample covariance matrix becomes singular  and most of its eigen values approach zero. Therefore  non linearity based dimen  sionality reduction methods have been considered. Isometric Mapping  ISOMAP   24   for example  estimates a lower dimensional embed  ding of data with high dimensions  by using geodesic distances on the graph. This method has found immense applications in revealing patterns in gene expression data  25 26 . t SNE  27  had been used as a default method for biomedical data and has found a plethora of applications in revealing inherent patterns in gene expression data. For example  t SNE  27  was used for identification of cancer subtypes using expression profiles in  28 29   and gene set variation analysis in breast cancer in  30 31 . However  t SNE has several limitations  firstly  it is stochastic in nature i.e. different runs of the algorithm can produce different results. Secondly  it is known to preserve only the local structure in the data  32 . Thirdly  it does not scale. In this paper  we try to address some of the problems mentioned above by presenting a framework based on Uniform Manifold Approx  imations and Projection  UMAP  and robust clustering OTRIMLE  for clustering patients into different subtypes. Both UMAP and OTRIMLE are robust and stable to small atypical observations in the data. The clustering is set up to achieve greater separation in terms of subtype specific survival curves measured by Kaplan Meier estimator. In fact  a clustering solution is searched around a complex shaped manifold that is optimal in terms of survival empirical evidence. The method examines many possible clustering results and selects one that is op  timal in terms of separability between survival curves. To deal with outliers and noise in the data  occurring mainly due to variations in experimental conditions and differences in experimental platforms   a  noise component     is added to separately model outliers and noise in the data.The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows  Section 2 in  troduces the methods on which the proposed methodology is based. Section 3 presents the proposed methodology along with methods to validate clustering results. In Section 4  we present datasets  ex  perimental results and comparisons with other methodologies. This section also presents the over representation analysis to identify path  ways disrupted in different subtypes  and in Section 5  conclusion is presented. 2. Preliminary theory In this section we introduce UMAP and OTRIMLE  on which the proposed methodology is based. UMAP learns the lower dimensional embedding of the data while preserving the notion of neighbourhood amongst data points. 2.1. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection  UMAP  UMAP  33  is a new technique for embedding data into lower dimensions. It is based on manifold learning paradigm and ideas from algebraic topology with strong mathematical background. Like t SNE  it is also non linear in nature but offers several advantages over t SNE. Firstly  it is deterministic in nature  i.e. multiple runs of UMAP give the same result. Secondly  it has no computational limitation on embedding dimension  allowing it to be used as a general purpose technique in machine learning pipeline. Thirdly  it maintains an overall balance in preserving the local and global neighbourhood of the data with a significantly shorter run time  34  Consider the data matrix                1    and   1     with taken as cardinality of patient pool and  as cardinality of genes  such that       . Theoretically  to map the data  that lies in high dimensions  to low dimensions  UMAP proceeds by gluing together local fuzzy simplicial set representations of a subset of data to build topological mappings in higher dimensions with consistent global structure. Simplicial complexes form the basis for UMAP  33  to capture the topology of the dataset. A simplex is a  dimensional convex hull formed out of    1objects with faces. For example  a point is a 0  simplex   line segment  with two end points  forms 1  simplex   triangle  formed by three points  is a 2  simplex . These simplices are joined together through faces to construct a  simplicial complex with being the dimensions corresponding to largest convex hull out of all simplices . Every simplicial complex is formed by the union of    1simplices   having non empty intersection for all   1simplices . This whole process is built by constructing a cech complex   which is a combinatorial method of transforming open cover to simplicial complex . While constructing simplicial complex   it is ensured that each data point is a neighbour of at least one other data point. This is achieved by creating balls of variable radii around each   until it stretches its  th neighbour. This validates the uniformity assumption of distribution on the manifold. To generate the final weighted graph  an edge is drawn between data points if their radii overlap. Let                1    and   1    be the lower dimensional estimation of     such that    . Each  represents the same original     but this time in the lower dimensional space. This lower dimensional embedding is initialized by Laplacian eigenmaps. From the lower dimensional space  a fuzzy local topological structure is computed in the similar fashion as described above and matched to original space. The two fuzzy simplicial set representations  and   are optimized through cross entropy loss to be as similar as possible to each other in terms of topological structure  by taking  as reference. From practical perspective  UMAP can be thought to work in two passes. Firstly  a weighted   neighbour graph  with weights signifying the closeness between two samples  is constructed in the original space where each point is assumed to be a neighbour of at least one point. This is achieved by using a variable radius for different density regions of the data  small radius for dense and large for sparse regions . Secondly  a similar low dimensional graph is estimated and optimized

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100907 3A.A. Rather and M.A. Chachoo using cross entropy lossto preserve geometry of data. The UMAP has three basic parameters                        and               herein  referred to as      respectively. The parameter  controls a balance between preservation of local and global structure in the data. Lower values of  focus more on local structure and higher values on the global structure. Parameter  controls how points are packed tightly together. The value of  ranges between  0 1   with smaller values preferred for clustering  33 . The parameter  controls the number of components to be retained  in the lower dimensional space  into which the data is embedded. UMAP has found widespread applications in biomedical research and is emerging as new choice for bioinformaticians. For example   35  were able to classify adreno  cortical carcinoma into two distinct groups correlating with patient survival from mRNA expression data using UMAP.  36  demonstrated the robustness of UMAP on proteomics noise on various proteomics datasets by comparing different clustering approaches on Alzheimer s Disease.  37  developed a molecular classification technique to classify renal carcinoma into different subtypes using transcriptomics data with UMAP. UMAP learns a lower dimensional embedding     with        by assuming data is distributed uniformly around a Riemannian man  ifold. This assumption guarantees that the notion of neighbourhood does not change in the lower dimensional embedding. UMAP uses non normalized exponential probability distributions in the higher di  mensional space. To estimate the similarity matrix of data points  UMAP defines two probability distributions    corresponding to      and   corresponding to     in two spaces   and  respectively. Mathematically  UMAP can be stated as  The probability that   is adjacent to   is given as                         1  Here  is an important parameter that ensures the local connectivity of the manifold. It represents the distance of   to its first nearest neighbour and         is the distance between   and      and  corresponds to a normalization factor. Hence      min                 1         2  and is defined as                       log2     3  The similarity of        in the lower space is given as        1  1          2   4  where   in Eq.  4  have a default value of  1.93 0.79 respectively and change as per changes in parameter  . The binary cross entropy between two probability densities  and  is used as a loss function and is given below  min                                   5  where          log              6  and     1          log 1         1           7  The process described above  results in data present in the orig  inal space  being embedded into lower dimensional space which is representative of the original space with regard to preservation of neighbourhood. The newly embedded dimensions are made to ap  pear as similar as possible to original space by the preservation of neighbourhood between two spaces.2.2. Model based clustering Clustering patients into subgroups from gene expression data is a difficult task. The existence of outliers and noise in the expres  sion matrix have a strong influence on the clustering solution. Every clustering algorithm introduces its own set of biases on the dataset to form the desired clusters  38 . As a result  none of the methods in clustering has emerged as a method of choice in clustering gene expression data. These facts make it compulsory to rationally apply the clustering algorithm to the problem at hand  and the noisy gene expression data is no exception. These issues have been extensively discussed in  39 41  with respect to gene expression data  and it is shown that model based clustering preform reasonably well on such data. To provide guard against noise and outliers in the data  we use Gaussian mixture model  MBC  based clustering for subtyping cancer patients. Robustification is achieved using improper density    for modelling noise and outliers. One potential advantage of using multi  variate Gaussians for cancer subtyping is smooth assignment of patients to subgroups which is desired in subtyping cancer patients where it is hard to determine patient s subgroup. This is because of inherent heterogeneity in the genotype and the phenotype of patients. Our aim is to cluster low dimensional embedding generated by UMAP     with     dimensions and  observations into  Gaussian components. Each component  is modelled as multivariate Gaussian distribution as                    1 2          1              2        8  where  and  are the mean vector and covariance matrix respec  tively and     is determinant of component      1 2     . The mixture  PDF  is defined as               1              9  where          is the  variate normal PDF of  th Gaussian compo  nent.  refers to the probability that sample   is a member of  th Gaussian component with    0and     1    1. Here vector  consists of unknown triplets                1    . Once the optimal model parameters of  are estimated  the posterior probability that an  th data point is drawn form  th component is given by                                        10  for   1   and   1     and  represents the ML estimates of  . After fitting mixture model  a probabilistic based clustering is applied to cluster data points into  clusters with regard to posterior probabilities          according to Eq.  10 . A data point   is assigned to that mixture component corresponding to which posterior probability is maximum. However  MBC suffers from instability even with few atypical observa  tions which are common in gene expression data. For robustification of clustering algorithms  various methods have been proposed. For ex  ample   42 43  suggested fitting noise outliers included in the data by adding uniform distribution to mixture components. Furthermore   41  employed distributions because of their heavier tails to model outliers present in the data   39  used  distributions to select only the relevant genes for clustering. While these methods have proven to be useful in many applications  there are still some problems associated with them as demonstrated by  44 45    a  they are not breakdown robust  even a single observation placed at a remote position breakdown clustering.  b  They do not have good asymptotic behaviour. To deal with the aforementioned issues we use OTRIMLE  46 47 . In OTRIMLE  robustification in terms of noise outliers is achieved by using a small improper constant density    in the Gaussian mixture. The aim of using improper density here is to identify outliers noise in the low density areas that cannot be member of any Gaussian mixture component and

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100907 4A.A. Rather and M.A. Chachoo this in turn improves the breakdown robustness. The new equation after incorporating improper constant density becomes                1               0   11  This represents the pseudo model  pseudo because of the improper density  where  0      1    1  with    0. contains all the parameters i.e.      0       1       1      . 0represents the probability that point   belongs to noise component. Further  the pseudo improper log likelihood function     is given as             1log          12  The following constrained optimization problem is solved to esti  mate the model parameters  max       1log          13                      14       1 0                 15      and    are the largest and smallest eigen values respectively of the covariance matrices across all Gaussian components.  here is referred as eigen ratio constraint and is responsible for putting restrictions on the shape of covariance matrix. Clusters are forced to be spherical for    1  like K means.  with large values allow clusters to take different shapes. Eq.  15  represents the  noise pro  portion constraint   NPC  i.e. maximum number of observations that can be assigned to noise component. This constraint guarantees that outliers noise  if any  are modelled as a separate Gaussian component called  noise component . If       0  single solution without any noise component is computed. The parameter     is set to 0.5 for maximum protection against outliers. This choice of     is reasonable if subject matter knowledge is not available  47 . Constants  and    ensure the existence of solution to Eq.  13 . 3. Proposed methodology Given a gene expression matrix     represented as      with  taken as cardinality of samples and  as cardinality of genes with     . The aim is to cluster samples into  clusters such that separation between subtype specific survival curves is maximized. The proposed methodology constitutes the following sequence of steps  1. Impute missing values in gene expression matrix by using MAD based imputation. 2. For each integer 1   70and0.001   0.8  apply UMAP to the gene expression matrix obtained in step 1 to estimate lower dimensional embeddings. 3. For each lower dimensional embedding obtained in step 2 for different pairs of        do the following   a  Apply the OTRIMLE algorithm to cluster the rows of gene expression matrix. Noise proportion constraint    max   is set to 0.5. This choice is sensible if domain knowledge is not available  47 .  b  Identify samples modelled as noise component  if any   and remove them.  c  Estimate the Kaplan Meier survival curves for each clus  tering solution and evaluate the separability of survival curves with regard to Restricted Life Expectancy Differ  ence  RLED   48 .4. The final clustering solution maximizing subtype specific sur  vival curves measured in terms of        is chosen for evalu  ation. 5. Identify genes expressed differently for each subtype and per  form over representation analysis to explore over represented pathways in each subtype. They could be used as therapeutic targets. To address the missing value problem in expression matrix  we did not removed any sample with missing values  since that would further increase the concentration ratio                and              and introduce the exceptional profusion of free parameters. we use median absolute deviation  MAD  based imputation to fill missing values. The choice of using MAD for filling missing values in gene expression data is well supported in the literature  49 50 . Fig. 1 depicts the graphic layout of the proposed methodology. 3.1. Validating cluster separation To validate the clustering results obtained through proposed methodology  the survival data is used to plot the Kaplan Meir plots corresponding to each cluster and verified for their clinical significance. There are various methods to quantify the separability of survival plots. The most commonly used criteria are median survival time and hazard ratio. However  they are relevant only when proportional hazards  PH  assumption agree  and the deviance from such assumption is not uncommon in time to event analysis  48 . An example of deviance from PH assumption is when one set of participants are allocated to instant surgical treatment and other to medical treatment. Surgery could escalate short term mortality  but nevertheless could extend benefits to survivors. PH does not apply in such cases  and hazard ratio results could be misleading. Other commonly used criteria include  1or 2distance measures. However  due to their lack of biological interpretation  they are not considered here. The intent is to obtain clusters with high separability between them in terms of Kaplan Meier plots. This  in turn  is guaranteed only if residual life patterns between subtypes have significant differences in prognosis. To measure such difference  we use Restricted Mean Survival Time  RMST  due to  48 . The advantage of this method is that it does not rely on proportional hazards assumption. Let       is the estimate of Kaplan Meier survival plot for cluster  . The RMST measures the life expectancy in group   and is defined as the area under curve below       from   0to      i.e.           0          16  For two groups                measures the life expectancy difference between two groups given as                  0             0          17        0                    18   represents the area between survival curves for cluster    and is referred to as Restricted Life Expectancy Difference  RLED . For   clusters  the cluster separation in terms of      is defined as   min  min          19  for      1         and is the number of subtype specific survival curves.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100907 5A.A. Rather and M.A. Chachoo Fig. 1. The approach proposed consists of a series of steps. First  the imputation of expression matrix is carried out. For this purpose  Median Absolute Deviation  MAD  based imputation is used. Then a lower dimensional embedding of gene expression matrix is estimated in the original space using a dimensionality reduction method called UMAP. In the lower dimensional embedding  robust clustering algorithm OTRIMLE is applied. On the resulting clustering solution  survival curves for all subgroups are estimated by Kaplan Meier estimator from survival data. The clustering solution that maximizes Restricted Life Expectancy Difference for subtype specific Kaplan Meier plots are chosen for evaluation. From the optimal clustering solution  the genes that show differential expression pattern in each subtype and all other subtypes are identified  and over representation analysis for each subtype is carried out to explore the biological significance of the subtypes obtained. This involves identifying different omics signatures for each subtype. Table 1 Description of the datasets used for evaluation of the proposed methodology.

Results and discussion We developed a robust framework for clustering cancer patients into different subtypes using their molecular profile of mRNA expression data. The proposed framework is evaluated by comparing the results with NEMO   18   SNF   15  and CC   13  on five types of standard cancer datasets. The brief descriptions of datasets used is given in Table 1 NEMO and SNF are briefly discussed in Section 1. Consensus clus  tering CC  refers to the situation where different clustering solutions for a dataset are sought for different values of  until a single clus  tering solution that represents consensus desired in terms of objective function is achieved. The parameters of SNF and NEMO are adjusted as recommended by authors and the parameter      of CC is varied between  10 32 and that value of      is chosen for evaluation which maximizes        . SNF and CC are implemented as part of cancer  subtypes package   50 . The resulting comparisons are done in terms of        and associated log         values. The detailed comparisons are given in Table 3. The framework is evaluated on five cancer datasets obtained from TCGA database using R package Tcga2stat  51 . Each dataset has anTable 2 Summary of the hyperparameters of proposed methodology. The column heading   BY   denotes the algorithm to which the parameter belongs.

The detailed discussion of hyperparameter tuning is given below. The proposed framework has a total of six hyperparameters to tune              and   out of which    and are contributed by UMAP and        and are contributed by OTRIMLE. They are discussed in detail in Section 2 and summarized in Table 2. The clustering results are found to be insensitive to changes in  . The parameter   is set to a constant value of 13 across all datasets to maintain a good balance between preservation of local and the global structure  while

Only for COLON data  the proposed methodology lacked behind SNF and CC in terms of        . However  the log        value is more significant for the proposed methodology over allmethods for COLON data. The detailed comparison is given in Table 3. The proposed methodology did not classify any samples as noise for LUNG data. However  12  49  6  14 samples were classified as noise in BREAST  GLIO  COLON and KIDNEY respectively. The noise sam  ples were discarded and not considered for evaluation. Figs. 3 and 4 show the survival curves of LUNG and BREAST data. Visually  subtype specific survival curves show more separability  less overlap  for the proposed methodology. Survival curves for GLIO  COLON and KIDNEY datasets are given in the supplementary material from figures 1 to 3. The framework proposed in this paper is able to discover statisti  cally and clinically significant subtypes having different omics signa  tures and greater separability in terms of subtype specific survival plots for multiple values of      . The separation of discovered subtypes is quantified in terms of        and corresponding  value. Only those survival outcomes are considered for which        is maximum and statistically significant  p  0.05  with corresponding survival curves having less overlap  verified visually . Note that the proposed methodology was run on Mac OS  1.8 GHz Dual Core Intel Core i5 with 8 GB of RAM and the total time taken in the worst case across all datasets was 72 s for each clustering result. 4.1. Pathway over representation analysis Pathway Over Representation Analysis  ORA  is a crucial method for clinicians to determine a set of over represented genes in the discovered subtypes. After obtaining the optimal subtypes in terms of          differentially expressed genes for each subtype and all other subtypes are identified with an R package limma  57 . Differentially expressed genes pertaining to each subtype are further categorized into up regulated and down regulated genes. To identify potential treat  ment targets  ORA is carried out with respect to KEGG database  58  for each subtype. Those pathways that are statistically significant in

For Pathways analysis concerning COLON  KIDNEY and GLIO datasets  please refer to the supplementary information under section 2. LUNG Cancer  For lung cancer  a total of 431 pathways are reported by KEGG pathway analysis  out of which 187 and 244 are from up and down  regulated genes respectively  of these 31  24  94  37 are from up  regulated genes in 4 subtypes  and 33  120  47  45 are from down  regulated genes. Fig. 5 represents some of the significant over  represented pathways related to LUNG cancer. One being Neuroactive ligand receptor interaction  NLCI  pathway  known to be related to smoking related lung cancer involving chromosome 15q25.1 locus  59  is found to be dysregulated in all four subtypes of lung cancer as shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore  NLCI is found to be remarkably enriched for down  regulated genes in fourth subtype with a  value of 0.01  statistically significant  and a gene ratio of 0.125. For lung cancer etiology  this pathway provides important insights  59 . Endocytosis refers to the process by which necessary substances are brought into the cell. It hasbeen seen that endocytosis  if derailed  can be a significant contributor to several hallmarks of cancer  including proliferation of cancer cells and apoptosis and hence  is one of the potential targets in Lung can  cer  60 61 . This pathway is found to be altered in two subtypes with a constant gene ratio of 0.05  with down regulated in second subtype  and up regulated in third subtype. Cortisol and Aldosterone hormones secreted by adrenal gland as a result of stimulation by Adrenocorti  cotropic  ACTH  hormone from pituitary gland are also found to be uniquely dysregulated in fourth subtype. The ectopic ACTH syndrome is found to be commonly associated with small cell lung cancer  62  63 . Calcium signalling pathway  regulated by Ca2 channels  is also found to be severely altered in first and fourth subtypes. Dysregulated Ca2 homeostasis is a characteristic feature of lung cancer. Targeting this pathway for cancer treatment has become an important research area  64 67 . BREAST Cancer  KEGG pathway analysis of the BREAST cancer reported 566 dif  ferent pathways with 302 from down and 264 from up regulated dif  ferentially expressed genes. Fig. 6 represents some of the significant over represented pathways related to LUNG cancer. Among these  47

Herpes simplex virus 1 HSV 1  pathway is found to be strongly affected in all five subtypes with up regulated in first and third cluster and down regulated in second  fourth and fifth cluster. Breast cells are permissive to HSV  which can be transmitted orally or sexually. The disparity of Cytokine expression patterns is common in breast cancer   70 . This is evident here also  as this pathway is dysregulated in only three of the five subtypes. Cytokines have been found to be instrumental in development  progression and metastasis of breast cancer   71 72 . TGB    for example  is responsible for cell death in the early stages. IL 6 produced by breast cancer cell lines  induces proliferation and aggressive phenotype. TNF     is shown to be highly expressed in breast carcinomas  induces the proliferation of T47D cells   71 73 . Cytokine interaction pathway is also found to be remarkably dysregulated in three subtypes. This pathway forms another potential target for the treatment of breast cancer   74 75 . Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  ALS  pathway can also be seen to be significantly altered in two subtypes with a consistent gene ratio of 0.07.

ORA for the remaining datasets and all other methods used for comparison is given in the supplementary material under section 2. 5. Conclusion The study in this paper proposes a novel methodology for robust clustering of cancer patients into molecular subtypes from gene expres  sion data. The clustering is set up to achieve maximum separation of the discovered subtypes  in terms of subtype specific survival curves. The technique lying at the heart of our approach is UMAP and a robust clus  tering OTRIMLE. The new dimensions into which the data is embedded by UMAP for different pairs of        is clustered by applying OTRIMLE. The evaluation of the methodology proposed includes comparisons with state of the art Neighbourhood based multi omics  NEMO   Similarity Network Fusion  SNF  and Consensus clustering  CC  on five datasets LUNG  BREAST  KIDNEY  GLIO and COLON obtained from TCGA. Restricted Life Expectancy Difference  RLED  criteria with associated log       value is used to measure the separability of patients in terms of Kaplan Meier plots for each cluster. Our methodology achieves better results with regard to separation of subtype specific survival

The subtypes discovered are differentiated further by performing differential expression anal  ysis corresponding to each subtype and over representation analysis is performed with regard to KEGG pathways database to explore the biological characteristics of the subtypes obtained. The results advocate that our approach is able to discover clinically and statistically signif  icant subtypes that have better separability with respect to survival  and its significance lies in reducing uncertainty in patient s expected outcome.
