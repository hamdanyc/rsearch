Based on  the evidence  type 2 diabetes mellitus  T2DM  is associated with the onset of HCC. The current work was con  ducted to discover molecular mechanisms and hub genes of both diseases concurrently by carrying out integrated  bioinformatics analysis.  Material and methods  In this study  the microarray datasets of HCC and T2DM diseases were retrieved from the  Gene Expression Omnibus  GEO  database. In order to identify differentially expressed genes  DEGs   datasets of  both diseases were analyzed by employing the GEO2R online tool separately. Shared DEGs between both diseases  were used for subsequent analyses. The Enrichr database was applied to evaluate the functional enrichment  analysis of DEGs. The STRING database was used to establish protein protein interaction  PPI  networks visu  alized using Cytoscape. The hub genes were defined using the cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape based upon the  degree method. The diagnostic accuracy of hub genes was evaluated using the area under the curve  AUC  values  obtained from receiver operating characteristic  ROC  curve analysis. Eventually  the interactions of the tran  scription factors  TFs  and microRNAs  miRNAs  with the hub genes were constructed by utilizing the Net  workanalyst database.  Results  A total of 98 common DEGs were found between HCC and T2DM datasets. PPI network acquired from the  STRING database was imported to the cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape  and 10 hub genes were screened based on  the degree method using the above plugin  which included BUB1  CDCA8  DLGAP5  ASPM  POLQ  CENPE   WDHD1  HELLS  TRIP13  and DEPDC1 . According to the ROC curve  all hub genes have a high diagnostic value   with high specificity and sensitivity. Among miRNAs  miR 192 5p was most correlated with the hub genes  and  regarding the TFs  E2F4 was identified as a transcription factor responsible for regulating most of the hub genes.  Conclusions  This research provides a novel vision about the progression and pathogenesis of HCC in T2DM  sufferers through bioinformatics tools. However  to verify key genes and biological pathways obtained from this  study  additional experiments are required.    1.Introduction  The incidence of liver cancers is the seventh highest globally  1 . The  most prevalent type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC    2   which rates fourth among cancer related deaths  3 . It is predicted  over 1.3 million people will lose their lives due to liver cancer by 2030  4 . In most cases  HCC is typically diagnosed when cancer has devel   oped to an advanced stage  in which case the treatment options are  limited. HCC is predominantly induced by chronic viral hepatitis and  alcoholism  5 . However  HCC may also develop due to other various  factors  including hyperglycemia  insulin resistance and insulin like  growth factor 1  IGF 1   and obesity  all of which induce inflammation   6 .

Lawson  and colleagues  1986  first reported that diabetes mellitus  DM  was  associated with HCC  10 .  Approximately 90  of diabetic patients suffer from T2DM  11 . A  significant characteristic of T2DM is the reduction in response to insulin   which is termed insulin resistance  12 .  Discovering the biomarkers of diseases can assist in diagnosing and  treating them. Appraisal of potential molecular biomarkers broadens  plenty of new ways to improve diagnostic and therapeutic options.  Bioinformatics encompasses a set of computational approaches for  assessing  clustering and verifying clinical and molecular biomarkers  aimed at treating and identifying diagnostic markers of disease  13 .  Applying various bioinformatics databases can identify differentially  expressed genes  biological pathways  proteins  and metabolites that  will ultimately lead to discovering candidate biomarkers of disease. Hua  et al. reported three upregulated hub genes  KPNA2  TARBP1  and  RNASEH2A genes  presenting diagnostic and prognostic values for HCC   14 .  Another research that investigated the genetic association of HCC  and T2DM using HCC  T2DM  and metformin treated datasets  high  lighted that 10 identified hub genes  CCNA2  CCNB1  MAD2L1  BU1B   RACGAP1  CHEK1  BUB1  ASPM  NCAPG  and TTK  were mostly linked  to the cell cycle. Results showed that while four genes  CCNA2  CCNB1   CHEK1  and BUB1  have decreased expression in metformin treated  samples  all of the hub genes  CCNA2  CCNB1  MAD2L1  BU1B  RAC  GAP1  CHEK1  BUB1  ASPM  NCAPG  and TTK  had a direct association  with lower overall survival in liver cancer patients  15 .  Few studies have been conducted on the association between T2DM  and HCC. Besides  the key genes  MicroRNAs  miRNAs   and transcrip   tion factors  TFs  participating in the development and pathogenesis of  HCC in individuals with T2DM have not been thoroughly investigated.  This study explored the mechanisms underlying the association between  T2DM and HCC and identified hub genes and miRNAs involved in both  diseases based on integrated bioinformatics approaches.  2.Materials and methods  2.1. Selection of data  The GEO database of NCBI is a publicly available repository of gene  expression datasets. The HCC  GSE101685  and T2DM  GSE23343   datasets were selected from the GEO database  https   www.ncbi.nlm.  nih.gov geo   . Table 1 contains complete information concerning  microarray datasets. 2.2. Identification of differentially expressed genes  GEO2R  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov geo geo2r     an interactive  online analysis tool  16   was used to identify DEGs for both diseases  separately. The genes that met the cutoff criteria  P value D0.05 and    log fold change  logFC   F1.0  were designated as DEGs. A volcano plot  was used to visualize all DEGs for both datasets. Venn diagrams were  applied to detect the intersecting part of the DEGs between HCC and  T2DM diseases. Shared DEGs between both diseases were utilized in  downstream analysis.  2.3. Functional enrichment analysis  The Gene Ontology  GO  and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Ge  nomes  KEGG  pathway analyses were performed using the Enrichr  database  17 . The KEGG pathway was employed to investigate mo  lecular pathways. The biological process  BP   cellular component  CC    and molecular function  MF  of DEGs were assessed using the GO  enrichment analysis. Statistical significance was assigned to terms with a  P value D0.05.  2.4. PPI network construction and hub genes identification  In order to establish the PPI network for DEGs  the STRING database   https   string db.org   was used  an online resource of protein protein  interactions that are known and predicted  18 . The interactions  parameter was set with high confidence  confidence score F0.7 . The  interactions between the proteins were visualized using the Cytoscape  software  a visualization tool for molecular interaction networks and  biological processes. Ultimately  utilizing the Cytohubba plugin of  Cytoscape  the top 10 DEGs associated with hub genes were identified  based on the degree method  highest degree of connectivity .  2.5. Validation of hub genes  The diagnostic value of hub genes in mRNA expression to differen   tiate control participants from patients for datasets of both diseases   GSE101685 and GSE23343  was investigated using the receiver oper  ating characteristic  ROC  curve. The area under the ROC curve  AUC   was computed and utilized to compare the diagnostic value of these hub  genes. The GraphPad Prism software was used for this analysis  version  9.3.0 .  2.6. Establishment of miRNA hub genes network  In order to investigate miRNAs of related hub genes  the Networka   nalyst database  https   www.networkanalyst.ca   was used  19 . The  Networkanalyst database is comprised of the miRTarBase  TarBase  and  miRcode databases. The miRTarBase database was used to explore in  teractions between miRNAs and hub genes. The visualization of  miRNA hub gene regulatory networks was carried out using the Cyto  scape platform.  2.7. Establishment of TF hub genes network  TFs of associated hub genes were analyzed using the Networkanalyst  database. The Networkanalyst contains the JASPAR  ENCODE  and  ChEA databases.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100956 3using the ChEA database.  3.Results  3.1. DEGs identification  In the current investigation  two microarray datasets associated with  HCC and T2DM diseases were collected from the GEO database  and  DEGs were identified by using GEO2R. Respectively  2050 and 1149  DEGs were discovered in the GSE101685  HCC controls  and GSE23343   T2DM controls  datasets. The genes that met the cutoff criteria  P value  D0.05 and  log fold change  logFC   F1.0  were identified as DEGs   which were then subjected to Venn diagrams to identify shared genes  across two microarray datasets. Significant and non significant DEGs for  both datasets were displayed by using the volcano plot  Fig. 1 . Even  tually  through the DEGs intersection of two datasets using Venn dia  grams  Fig. 2   in total  97 common DEGs were found that are shared  among HCC and T2DM diseases. The list of shared gene names between  HCC and T2DM is shown in supplementary file 1.  3.2. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs  Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was assessed using the  Enrichr database. GO enrichment analysis showed that in the BP cate  gory  Fig. 3   DEGs were most enriched in processes such as the   negative regulation of wound healing    GO 0061045    centromere  complex assembly    GO 0034508   and kinetochore assembly   GO 0051382 . For the CC category  Fig. 3   DEGs were involved in the   intermediate filament cytoskeleton    GO 0045111   intracellular non   membrane bounded organelle  GO 0043232   and the endoplasmic re  ticulum lumen  GO 0005788 . For the MF category  Fig. 3   DEGs were  enriched mainly in  protease binding    GO 00020202    chemorepellent  activity    GO 0045499   and  histone demethylase activity     GO 0032452 . Also  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis  Fig. 4   revealed that most significantly enriched pathways are the cell cycle   NF  B signaling pathway  and pancreatic cancer.  3.3. PPI network construction and selection of hub genes  PPI network of DEGs  Fig. 5   including 51 nodes and 102 edges   received from STRING were imported to the Cytohubba plugin of  Cytoscape in order to identify the hub genes. The ten hub genes with the  highest degree of connectivity were BUB1  CDCA8  DLGAP5  ASPM   POLQ  CENPE  WDHD1  HELLS  TRIP13  and DEPDC1. Topological properties of hub genes are shown in supplementary file 2.  3.4. Validation of hub genes  The ROC curve was utilized to evaluate the hub genes   prediction  accuracy. AUC was determined and used to compare these hub genes    diagnostic values. ROC curves and AUC values of datasets are shown in  Fig. 6 and supplementary file 3. Based on the results  computed AUC  values in this study ranged from 0.7 to 1 in both diseases  which is  regarded to have high discriminative power. The expression levels of  these hub genes demonstrated high diagnostic value  according to the  ROC analysis.  3.5. Examination of the regulatory network of miRNA hub genes  MiRNAs targeting hub genes were obtained from the Networkanalyst  online database and visualized utilizing Cytoscape in this step  Fig. 7 .  Hsa mir 192 5p had the highest level of interaction  degree 6  with the  hub genes and was considered as a major miRNA.  3.6. Examination of the regulatory network of TF hub genes  TFs targeting hub genes were achieved from the Networkanalyst  database and visualized using Cytoscape  Fig. 8 . The TF hub gene  network demonstrated that the E2F transcription factor 4  E2F4  regu  lates 9 hub genes and can play an essential role in the progression of HCC  and T2DM diseases.  4.Discussion  Hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC  is the fourth highest cause of  cancer related death worldwide. Different types of chronic hepatitis   alcoholism  metabolic liver disease  chiefly nonalcoholic fatty liver  disease   and T2DM are risk factors for HCC  7 20 . The association of  T2DM  one of the most frequent metabolic disorders  with HCC has  attracted much attention. Furthermore  some observational in  vestigations have found that T2DM is correlated with a raised mortality  rate in individuals with HCC  21 . Despite multiple examinations on the  relationship between T2DM and HCC  the presumed underlying mech   anisms linking T2DM and HCC are still not clearly understood  22 . This  current research examines the relationship between T2DM and HCC  using an integrated bioinformatics approach  including GO enrichment  and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses  PPI network construction  hub  gene identification  miRNA hub gene  and TF hub gene interactions.  GO analysis demonstrated that DEGs are mostly enriched in terms  such as  centromere complex assembly    BP    intermediate filament  cytoskeleton    CC   and  protease binding    MF   Which play a role in  the occurrence and progression of both diseases.  KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were mainly  enriched in pathways such as the cell cycle  NF Kappa B signaling  pathway  and the AGE RAGE signaling in diabetic complications  these  pathways probably play a role in the development of both diseases   simultaneously. For instance  the nuclear factor kappa B  NF   B  is a  multifunctional transcription factor that plays a major role in regulating  cell survival  proliferation  the innate immune system  and inflamma   tion. The NF  B signaling system establishes a link between pathogenic  and cellular danger signals  thereby coordinating cellular defenses  against invading pathogens  23 . Inactivating NF  B in the liver stim  ulates hepatocarcinogenesis and induces the development of hepato   cellular carcinoma  HCC   implying that NF  B acts as a tumor  suppressor in hepatocytes  24 . Furthermore  recent evidence indicated  that elevated NF  B signaling might contribute to the development of  insulin resistance. Increased activity of this transcription factor has been  frequently observed in diabetic patients  25 .  In the present study  a total of 10 hub genes have been identified that  are shared in both HCC and T2DM based on the highest degree of  Fig. 1.Venn diagrams. 97 common genes were identified between GSE101685   HCC controls  and GSE23343  T2DM controls  datasets.

Maddah et al.

Thus  these genes  might play an essential role in developing HCC in T2DM patients.  For example  BUB1  a mitotic checkpoint serine threonine kinase   has been implicated as an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene in diverse  malignancies such as liver cancers. By activating SMAD2 phosphoryla   tion  BUB1 stimulates the proliferation of liver cancer cells  26 . How  ever  BUB1  s function in the development of T2DM has not yet been  reported to be associated with HCC in T2DM patients. Overall  BUB1  could be regarded as a molecular biomarker in the pathogenesis  diag  nosis  and management of HCC in T2DM cases.  Cell division cycle associated 8  CDCA8   another hub gene  is a  component of the chromosomal passenger complex  CPC  required for  the bipolar mitotic spindle to remain stable. Based on the evidence   CDCA8 might have a potential diagnostic and predictive importance for  HCC  27 . However  the role of this gene in the incidence of T2DM is still  unknown and has not been reported. Consequently  CDCA8 may be  considered a biological indicator in both conditions.  Discs large associated protein 5  DLGAP5  is a microtubule   associated protein that has been shown to play an oncogenic function  in carcinogenesis  particularly lung cancer and hepatocellular carci  noma  28 . Studies revealed that silencing DLGAP5 effectively prevents  hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and pathogenesis  29 .  However  the relevance of this gene in the occurrence of T2DM is un  certain and has not yet been reported.  In our research  among the miRNAs  miR 192 5p was found to have  the most interactions with the hub genes. Current findings have  demonstrated that miR 192 5p  a constituent of the miR 192 family   involves a wide range of human cancers such as the liver  lung  and  breast cancers. The function of miR 192 5p in HCC has been evaluated.  A comprehensive study in 2015 showed that miR 192 5p might be a  Fig. 2.Volcano plot of DGES for both datasets that blue dots represent down regulated genes and red dots represent up regulated genes.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100956 5useful early serum biomarker for identifying HCC  30 .  Additionally  miR 192 5p can be a diagnostic biomarker for the  prediction of diabetes. Researchers have demonstrated that miR 192 5p  expression in bio fluids  such as urine and serum  is related to the  occurrence of diabetes  31 32 . Hence  miR 192 5p might have a crucial  role in the advancement of both diseases.  In our survey  the transcription factor  E2F4  was found to regulate  most of the hub genes. E2F4 is a transcriptional repressor concerned  with cell cycle arrest  which is dependent on its interaction with mem  bers of the RB family. Based on the evidence  findings imply that E2F4  may contribute to the evolution of HCC and may serve as a potential  biomarker for diagnosis of HCC and its progression  33 . Although  the  correlation between E2F4 and T2DM has not yet been elucidated  but  E2F4 might have a crucial function in the development of HCC and  T2DM diseases.  Despite our novel findings  our study is also comprised of some  limitations. First  this study identified evidence of the precise roles of the identified genes and disclosed the mechanisms behind the progress of  both diseases by using bioinformatics tools  as a result  future in vivo and  in vitro examinations of the results are required to validate the role of  the nominated hub genes. Furthermore  the expression and prognostic  roles of the ten hub genes at the protein level need further investigation.  Besides  the datasets used in this study are the microarray technique.  Datasets from more powerful techniques such as RNA seq duo to  improved specificity and it s better at detecting transcripts might yield  more valid results.  5.Conclusions  In this current work  a total of 10 hub genes  BUB1  CDCA8  DLGAP5   ASPM  POLQ  CENPE  WDHD1  HELLS  TRIP13  and DEPDC1   1 miRNA   miR 192 5p   and 1 TF  E2F4  were identified that might be critical in  the pathogenesis and progression of HCC and T2DM diseases.
