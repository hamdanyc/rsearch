Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato  E. granulosus s.  l.  represent a major threat worldwide  particularly in those areas where  livestock are raised for different purposes such as the Mediterranean  area  South America and Central Asia  3 5 . The infection has been  eliminated from Tasmania and New Zealand in the Oceania  6 . The  most highlighted part in the life cycle of E. granulosus is slowly growing  larval stages  metacestodes  in liver and lungs of affected intermediate  hosts  ungulates  and dead end hosts  humans . Carnivores  as definitive  hosts  ingest the infected carcasses and gravid worms may develop  within their intestine  which contain thousands of eggs  shedding  through feces into the environment. Human infection occurs acciden   tally through ingestion of food water resources contaminated with the  parasitic ova  7 . Several major risk factors may be involved for human  cystic echinococcosis  CE   encompassing living in rural areas  dog  ownership  low country income level  free roaming dogs and feeding  dogs with infected viscera  8   which inflicts disability and impotency to affected individuals  9 . Extensive genetic diversity has  also  been  distinguished in E. granulosus s.l.  with G1 as the most isolated genotype  from animal and human samples worldwide  10 .  In spite of the wide administration of anthelminthic chemothera   peutics  improved hygiene in slaughterhouses  praziquantel therapy of  owned and or shelter dogs and educational health programs  CE still  represents considerable morbidity by 1 200 per 100 000 individuals   11 . Moreover  drug resistance parasites may be a big concern  because  of long lasting under dosing of anti parasitic drugs. On this premise   control measures such as vaccination strategies in both definitive and  intermediate hosts seem to be more efficacious for improved prevention  of CE  12 13 . An ideal anti E. granulosus s.l. vaccine may either prevent  the evolution of oncosphere to hydatid cyst or prevent the maturation of  intestinal worms  2 . Next generation vaccine design relies on the  stringent prediction  screening and selection of highly antigenic   non allergenic  soluble protein components known as immunogenic  epitopes  being employed towards engineering multi epitope vaccine  constructs  14   in this sense  gaining enough knowledge on the parasite  life cycle and the discovery of the involved antigens in each stage is an  extremely crucial step for a rational vaccine design  15 .

One of the well known  vaccine targets is the oncospheral antigen  EG95  with high rate of  immunoprophylactic capacity  as shown to prevent CE transmission  during basic and field trials in South America and China  17 . The  cyclophilin proteins are found as evolutionary conserved molecules in a  wide range of organisms  with essential role in protein folding processes   18 . Due to the lack of bioinformatics analysis on E. granulosus cyclo   philin  EgCyc  regarding biochemical properties and potential immu   nogenic epitopes  the present in silico study was performed to be a  premise for future vaccination studies.  2.Methods  2.1. Amino acid sequence of EgCyc protein  The whole amino acid sequence of EgCyc protein was retrieved from  the National Center for Biotechnology Information  NCBI  database   available at https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov    under accession number of  AAN62875.1.  2.2. Prediction of physico chemical parameters  Some of the basic physico chemical properties of the EgCyc protein  were predicted using ExPasy ProtParam online server  https   web.exp  asy.org protparam     which demonstrates the amino acid residues   isoelectric point  pI   molecular weight  MW   instability index   aliphatic index  AI   grand average of hydropathicity  GRAVY   in vitro  and in vivo estimated half life  extinction coefficients as well as positive  and negative charged residues  19 .  2.3. Prediction of antigenicity  allergenicity and solubility profiles  Protein antigenicity was evaluated using two web servers  VaxiJen  v2.0  http   www.ddg pharmfac.net vaxijen VaxiJen VaxiJen.html    and ANTIGENpro  http   scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu   . The latter  mostly applies microarray analysis data for prediction  independent of  pathogen and alignment  20 . The novel alignment free prediction of  VaxiJen v2.0 is exerted through an auto cross covariance mediated  sequence transformation into uniform vectors of primary amino acid  properties  with prediction accuracy of 70   89   21 . In the following   AllergenFP v1.0  https   ddg pharmfac.net AllergenFP     22   Aller  TOP v2.0  https   www.ddg pharmfac.net AllerTOP     23  and  AlgPred  http   crdd.osdd.net raghava algpred    web servers were  employed for the screening of allergenicity and potential MEME  Mul  tiple Em for Motif Elicitation  MAST  Motif Alignment and Search Tool   motifs as well as IgE epitopes in the submitted protein sequence. Finally   solubility of the protein was assessed  this server yields a population  average for the experimental dataset  0.45  and any values above this  level is considered to be soluble  https   protein sol.manchester.ac.uk      24 .  2.4. Determination of post translational modification  PTM  sites  The presence of several putative PTM sites were in silico analyzed in  the examined protein sequence using online servers such as CSS Palm   http   csspalm.biocuckoo.org     25  and GPS PAIL 2.0  http   pail.  biocuckoo.org     26   The cuckoo workgroup  and NetNGlyc  htt  ps   services.healthtech.dtu.dk service.php NetNGlyc 1.0    NetOGlyc   https   services.healthtech.dtu.dk service.php NetOGlyc 4.0    27   and NetPhos  https   services.healthtech.dtu.dk service.php NetPhos   3.1   28   DTU health tech services  in order to predict palmitoyla   tion  acetylation  N  and O glycosylation as well as phosphorylation  sites. 2.5. Prediction of transmembrane domain  signal peptide and subcellular  localization  Prediction of transmembrane helices in EgCyc protein was done  using TMHMM 2.0 server  DTU health tech services   being available at  https   services.healthtech.dtu.dk service.php TMHMM 2.0 . In addi  tion  the presence of a putative signal peptide and the estimated sub  cellular localization of this protein were analyzed through SignalP  29   and DeepLoc 1.0  30  web tools of the DTU health tech services  https     services.healthtech.dtu.dk   .  2.6. Secondary structure and disulfide bond prediction  The NetSurfP2.0 web server was utilized for the in silico prediction of  the secondary structure of EgCyc protein  which is accessible at htt  ps   services.healthtech.dtu.dk service.php NetSurfP 2.0  31 . In the  following  the DiANNA online tool was used as a unified software for  cysteine state and disulfide bond partner prediction  http   clavius.bc.  edu  clotelab DiANNA     32 .  2.7. Three dimensional  3D  model construction  refinement and  validations  The putative 3D model of the EgCyc protein was constructed and  predicted using a homology modelling procedure by SWISS MODEL  web server  https   swissmodel.expasy.org     33 . Subsequently  Gal  axyRefine server was employed to refine the most suitable 3D model   relied on a CASP10 tested refinement method  https   galaxy.seoklab.  org cgi bin submit.cgi type  REFINE    34 . Next  the global quality  of the refined structure was validated using Ramachandran analysis by  PROCHECK tool of SAVES 6.0 server  https   saves.mbi.ucla.edu      35 .  2.8. Continuous and conformational B cell epitope predictions  In order to predict linear B cell epitopes of EgCyc protein  several  web servers were used  including Bcepred  ABCpred and B cell tool of  the Immune Epitope Database  IEDB  server. The Bcepred server em  ploys physico chemical parameters such as turns  exposed surface   flexibility  polarity  hydrophilicity and accessibility for prediction  with  an accuracy of 58.70   http   crdd.osdd.net raghava bcepred     36 .  The ABCpred web server depends on an artificial neural network  ANN   method for the prediction  http   crdd.osdd.net raghava abcpred      37   while B cell tool of IEDB server predicts B cell epitopes  BepiPred   along with beta turn  flexibility  antigenicity  hydrophilicity and surface  accessibility in a graphical manner  http   tools.iedb.org bcell   . As  well  the conformational B cell epitopes of the protein were predicted  using ElliPro tool of the IEDB online server  being available at  http   tools.iedb.org ellipro   38 .  2.9. Prediction and screening of mouse and human MHC binding epitopes  In current study  different mouse and human MHC alleles were used  for the prediction of the most immunogenic epitopes derived from EgCyc  protein  http   tools.iedb.org mhci     http   tools.iedb.org mhcii     in  order to make the results more applicable to the clinic  39 40 . For this  aim  eight mouse MHC I alleles  H2 Db  H2 Dd  H2 Kb  H2 Kd  H2 Kk   H2 Ld  H2 Qa1 and H2 Qa2  and three mouse MHC II alleles  H2 IAb   H2 IAd and H2 IEd  were used. Furthermore  human alleles of  HLAA 02 01  HLA A 24 02  MHC I   DRB1 01 02 and  DQA1 05 01 DQB1 03 01  MHC II  were employed for this prediction.  For all MHC I and MHC II prediction  12 mer and 15 mer epitopes were  predicted using IEDB recommended 2020.09  NetMHCPan EL 4.1  and  IEDB recommended 2.22 method  respectively. The outputs are pro  vided in percentile ranks  so that lower ranks demonstrate higher  epitope affinity to a given MHC allele. All high ranked epitopes were S. Khazaei and Z.

Prediction and screening of human cytotoxic T lymphocyte  CTL   epitopes  NetCTL 1.2 web server is one of the best tools for the prediction of  human CTL epitopes  which computationally identifies epitopes  regarding to the 12 major MHC I supertypes. In this study  CTL epitopes  were predicted in terms of the most common MHC I supertypes in the  world human population  A1  A2  A3 and B7   41 . Subsequently  these  epitopes were screened with respect to immunogenicity and allerge   nicity using MHCI immunogenicity tool of the IEDB and  http   tools.  iedb.org immunogenicity    AllerTOP v2.0 server  respectively.  2.11. Protein protein docking between EgCyc and HLA DR receptor  For this purpose  the PDB file of HLA DR receptor was obtained from  the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics  RCSB  data  base  42   under PDB ID of 6NIX. The molecular docking process was  performed using the ClusPro 2.0 web server  43  and the most populated  docking pose with the lowest energy was selected for visualization.  3.Results  3.1. Physico chemical properties of EgCyc protein  Based on the ProtParam web server  this protein was shown to  possess 162 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 17354.65  Da. The speculated pI of EgCyc protein was estimated to be relatively  acidic in nature  6.41 . Relatively equal number of positively   Arg   Lys  and negatively charged  Asp  Glu  residues were predicted for the  protein  17 vs 18 . The extinction coefficient of this protein in water was  8730  assuming all pairs of Cys residues form cystines  and 8480   assuming all Cys residues are reduced . The half life of the protein was  calculated to be 30 h  mammalian reticulocytes  in vitro   F20 h  yeast   in vivo  and F10 h  Escherichia coli  in vivo . The EgCyc protein was  shown to be highly stable  having instability index of 12.19. Also  the  aliphatic index of 60.12 showed that this protein is relatively thermo   tolerant in nature  whereas a negative GRAVY score of  0.217 demon   strated the protein as a hydrophilic protein.  3.2. Antigenicity  allergenicity and solubility characteristics of EgCyc  protein  The antigenicity of the EgCyc protein was estimated using ANTI   GENpro  0.920460  and VaxiJen v2.0  0.6427  web servers  demon   strating adequate antigenicity. AllerTOP and AllergenFP servers  demonstrated that the protein is allergenic in nature. In a similar  manner  combined prediction approach employed by the AlgPred web  server showed allergenicity for EgCyc protein. However  the latter  server demonstrated no MEME MAST motifs and IgE epitopes within  the protein sequence. Moreover  the protein was highly soluble  showing  a solubility score of 0.539 in Protein Sol server  Fig. 1 .  3.3. Subcellular localization  PTM sites  transmembrane domain and  signal peptide prediction  DeepLoc server showed that EgCyc protein is a cytoplasmic  proba   bility score of 0.7337  and soluble protein  likelihood  0.0162   Fig. 2    without a transmembrane domain and signal peptide  as predicted using  TMHMM and SignalP servers  respectively. It was shown that 2 N   glycosylation sites and 14 phosphorylation sites  including 11 serine and  3 tyrosine phosphorylation sites  are present in the EgCyc protein   Fig. 3   while there were no acetylation and O Glycosylation sites in the  protein. 3.4. Secondary structure and disulfide bond prediction  Secondary structure analysis using NetSurfP2.0 server demonstrated  that the protein is dominated by coils  followed by strand and helices   Fig. 4 . Also  the output of the DiANNA web tool showed that the  cysteines are expectedly form disulfide bonds at the following positions   6 16  PKFTKCRSPER   RETFSCHWTLG   42 53  QEWKECPDYVS    AGENSCYFNSS  and 67 81  IWIPYCIKLTS   TVDEKCFSVDE .

Prediction of linear and conformational B cell epitopes  Prediction by ABCpred web server was done based on a 0.65  threshold  yielding a total number of 10 potential linear B cell epitopes   Table 1 . Moreover  several continuous B cell epitopes were found in  the EgCyc protein according to various physico chemical properties   comprising hydrophilicity  flexibility  accessibility  turns  exposed sur  face  polarity and antigenic propensity  Table 2 . In the meanwhile  a  third web server  IEDB  was employed to determine potential linear B   cell epitopes within the protein sequence in a graphical manner  which is  illustrated in Fig. 7. Pertinent to this prediction  the average scores of  Chou and Fasman turn  Emini surface accessibility  Karplus   Schulz  flexibility  Kolaskar   Tongaonkar antigenicity  Parker hydrophilicity  and Bepipred linear epitopes were calculated to be 1.024  1.000  1.014   1.007  1.942 and 0.201 respectively.

Moreover   in multiple areas of endemicity basic preventive measures such as sur  veillance programs in farms or slaughterhouses and implementation of  hygienic measures regarding dog sheep human contacts are being  planned and applied  17 . All of these therapeutic and or preventive  approaches inevitably cause considerable financial burden to many  countries  in particular under developed nations. Therefore  vaccination  strategies seem more rational for an improved prevention of CE globally Table 3  Prediction of the high ranked epitopes with specific binding capacity for mouse MHC molecules using IEDB server with subsequent screening regarding antigenicity  and allergenicity.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100925 8 11 . Several attempts were done to produce an efficient vaccine against  E. granulosus s.l. worldwide. However  due to the multi host nature of  the E. granulosus life cycle  2  and the immune evasion mechanisms  employed by such a complex parasite  47 48   developing an ideal  vaccination approach is a key challenge for researchers. In this sense   immunoinformatics based machine learning approaches such as devel   oped web servers and or standalone software have facilitated the  identification of novel antigenic proteins and their potential immuno   genic epitopes  49 . The cyclophilin protein is an  evolutionary conserved molecule in various organisms  which performs  enzymatic peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity  providing major roles in  protein folding processes  18 . In the present study  we comprehensively  analyzed and screened some of the immunodominant B  and T cell  epitopes for mouse and human as well as predicted some basic  biochemical properties for the cyclophilin of E. granulosus s.l.  EgCyc   protein using a variety of in silico online tools.  At the initial step  some basic physico chemical characteristics of the  EgCyc protein were predicted using ProtParam web server. The output  showed that this protein possesses 162 residues with a 17.35 kDa mo  lecular weight  suggesting adequate antigenicity  it is said that proteins  having a molecular weight below 5 10 kDa are considered as poor im  munogens  7 39 . Also  the protein was rendered as relatively acidic   with a pI of 6.41. Instability index of this protein was calculated to be  12.19  indicating a highly stable molecule. Moreover  a relatively high  aliphatic index and a negative GRAVY score demonstrate the EgCyc  protein is somehow thermotolerant and hydrophilic in nature  respec   tively. On this basis  the protein could tolerate a wide range of tem  peratures and better interacts with the surrounding water based milieu.  According to the VaxiJen v2.0 and ANTIGENpro servers  the protein  demonstrated high rate of antigenicity  while it was substantiated to be  allergenic in nature  hence  it deserves to be further excavated regarding antigenic  though non allergenic epitopes. Moreover  the protein was  highly soluble  showing a solubility score of 0.539 in Protein Sol server.  Altogether  these basic features are necessary for future wet laboratory  experiments. Reportedly  PTM sites have a crucial role in a number of  cellular processes and identification of these regions would be beneficial  in proper selection of eukaryotic and or prokaryotic protein expression  platforms  50 . In this context  various web servers were used to predict  phosphorylation  glycosylation and acetylation sites in the protein. In  this regard  only 14 phosphorylation and 2 N glycosylation sites were  found in EgCyc protein. In addition  the protein had no transmembrane  domain and signal peptide  51 .  In the second step of this study  secondary and tertiary  3D  struc  tures of EgCyc protein were predicted using NetSurfP2.0 and SWISS   MODEL web servers  respectively. Based on the former server  coils  were found in the most parts of the sequence  without specific disor   dered regions. In general  disulfide bonds reinforce the conformation of  a protein  hence  we predicted these structures in the protein using  DiANNA web servers. Based on the server  disulfide bonds were pre  dicted in the following positions  6 16  PKFTKCRSPER    RETFSCHWTLG   42 53  QEWKECPDYVS   AGENSCYFNSS  and 67 81   IWIPYCIKLTS   TVDEKCFSVDE . In the following  3D structure of the  protein was predicted using SWISS MODEL to better realize the  conformation of the submitted protein sequence. Although   A major  concern in structural biology is the identification of faults in experi   mental and theoretical models of protein structures    52 . Therefore   rehashing and subsequent validation is a necessary step to improve the  quality and reliability of the initially constructed 3D model. For this  purpose  GalaxyRefine web server was employed  which generated top  five refined models to be selected for further validation. In our study   model number 3 was selected  having GDT HA of 0.9984  RMSD of  0.233  MolProbity of 1.550  Clash score of 10.8  Poor rotamers of 0.0  and Rama favored of 98.7. Finally  the PROCHECK results  Ramachan   dran plot analysis  showed quality enhancements in the refined model   in comparison with the crude model  53 54 .  Induction of adequate immunity against CE depends on the proper  sensing of B  and T cells to provoke humoral and cell mediated immune  responses. Emerging computer based vaccinology approaches pave the  way for efficient induction of these immune responses and to better limit  the parasite replication and propagation  55 . In this study  we applied  several methods and web tools to predict B  and T cell epitopes of EgCyc  protein to achieve the highest accuracy in prediction. For the identifi   cation of continuous B cell epitopes  Bcepred  IEDB  and ABCpred online  servers were utilized. Reportedly  the accuracy of prediction of Bcepred  and ABCpred servers are estimated as 52.92  57.93  and 65.93    respectively. Both web servers revealed various linear B cell epitopes.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100925 9Conformational B cell epitopes are vital for antigen antibody interaction   56   for this aim  ElliPro tool of IEDB server was used  which deter   mined 3 conformational B cell epitopes. Moreover  T cell and MHC  interplay are highly essential for a proper cell mediate immune  response  in this regard  several MHC binding epitopes were predicted  with respect to various mouse and human MHC alleles using IEDB web  server. Based on our findings  multiple antigenic  non allergenic epi  topes were predicted in the context of 11 mouse MHC alleles. With  respect to human MHC molecules  8 epitopes possessed adequate anti  genicity without allergenicity traits  including  VVFGEVESGEDV     VaxiJen score  0.9263    SIYGSKFEDENF    VaxiJen score  2.0078     IYGSKFEDENFN    VaxiJen score  1.8441    FFITTAVTSWLDGKH     VaxiJen score  0.7619    QFFITTAVTSWLDGK    VaxiJen score   1.0146    FDISIGGKPAGRIVF    VaxiJen score  0.9623    SIGGKPA   GRIVFALF    VaxiJen score  1.2736   and  FFDISIGGKPAGRIV    Vax  iJen score  1.1182 . In the final step  NetCTL server was employed for  the prediction of human CTL epitopes with regard to the most prevalent  MHC supertypes worldwide. The output of the server showed 8 qualified  epitopes  enclosing  CTGEKGFGY     WLDGKHVVF    A1 supertype     ALFDDVPKT     SQFFITTAV    A2 supertype    MLSMANAGK      KGFGYKGSK    A3 supertype    KPAGRIVFA   and  KTVENFRAL    B7  supertype . Overall  these qualified epitopes can be utilized alone  and or combined with potential epitopes derived from other vaccine  antigens to design and engineer an efficacious multi epitope vaccine  construct to be evaluated against CE in future. Ultimately  likely inter  action between the protein and a HLA DR molecule was predicted using  ClusPro server  indicating some interactions between the protein and  chains A and B of the MHC molecule.  5.Conclusion  The larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus demonstrate a serious  threat to the human health and livestock production. Attempts in  vaccination studies against this infection continue and have even been  enhanced by sophisticated computer aided bioinformatics web tools in  recent years. The present in silico study provided some of the basic  physico chemical properties of EgCyc protein  its structural modelling  and predicted some of the antigenic  non allergenic B  and T cell epi  topes for this protein. Undoubtedly  the findings of the present investi   gation should be validated in experimental settings and would assist  researchers for future immunization against CE.
