The study investigated mental health  measures that include depression  stress  and anxiety  and their correlation with gender and age among Jorda   nians in the COVID 19 era. This investigation adopted a quantitative  cross sectional  and descriptive design and  included 1587 subjects recruited through a convenient sampling approach. Jordanians   18 years old  were  recruited in the study. The total DASS score of the whole sample was 32.7  0.67. The DASS scale showed  significantly high scores for stress  anxiety  and depression in the groups that perceived a moderate high  probability of infection with COVID 19  P D0.05 . The stress score was greater  P D0.001  in the men   11.39  0.469  compared to the women  10.74  0.33 . On the other hand  anxiety and depression scores were  higher in women than men  8.13  0.25  and 12.71  0.30 respectively . Finally  DASS total score significantly  decreased with the increasing age of the participants  P D0.001 . Many Jordanians experienced moderate to  severe depression  stress  and anxiety during the COVID 19 era. Such experience was associated with the sex and  age of subjects. The results of this study will benefit decision makers in establishing a plan to prevent the  consequences of these mental disorders during pandemics.    1.Introduction  Pandemics that occurred in the past caused fear to the public  and  most people developed anxiety and fear related behavioral issues.  Coronavirus disease of 2019  COVID 19  overwhelmed the world with  panic  uncertainties  and possibilities of fatal outcomes  1 3 . The  public has experienced anxiety  depression  psychological distress   post traumatic stress disorder  and insomnia  3 4 . A systematic review  documenting studies from Asia and Europe revealed that 29.6   31.9    and 33.7  have experienced stress  anxiety  and depression  respec   tively  5 . Similar findings were reported in studies that included several  countries from three continents  6 7 . These psychological changes have  been attributed mainly to fear of contracting the disease  the financial  need to work  and the inability to avoid interacting with the public  8 9 .  The infections or death of a family member could impact the mental  wellbeing of individuals including experiencing fear and depression  10   11 . At the same time  those in quarantine experience loneliness  boredom  and anger. Studies have shown that individuals experiencing  overwhelming emotional traumas and socioeconomic stressors during  COVID 19 were more vulnerable to committing suicide  12 13 . It is  suggested that governments that implemented strict measures to reduce  transmission of COVID 19 during the onset of the pandemic could  benefit the mental health of their population  14 .  According to recent publications  mental health issues during  COVID 19 have been linked to socioeconomic status  gender  occupa   tion  COVID 19 like symptoms  social support  interpersonal conflicts   and perceptions of the impact of COVID 19  15 17 . As argued by  Holmes et al.  18   older adults and those with low incomes are more  susceptible to poor mental health. In addition  a meta analysis showed  that people with pre existing mood disorders are at increased risk of  hospitalization and death for COVID 19 compared to the general pop  ulation  19 . Furthermore  it has been shown that the risk of depressive  symptoms persists for weeks after infection with COVID 19  20 . Thus  it  is crucial to determine the psychological changes to develop strategies to   Corresponding author.

Therefore  this study determined the rela  tionship of age and gender with the prevalence of psychological mea  sures among Jordanians during the COVID 19 era.  2.Methods  2.1. Study design and sampling method  This study adopted a quantitative  cross sectional  and descriptive  design to assess the measures of mental health during COVID 19.  Additionally  the relationship of age and gender with mental health  measures was examined.  A convenience sampling method was used to select study partici   pants. Jordanians aged 18 years and above were included in the study.  Further  individuals younger than 18 years old and those not residing in  Jordan were excluded from the study. The purpose  voluntary partici   pation  survey length  confidentiality issues  and potential risks and  benefits of the study were explained on the first page. The first page also  includes instructions for the participants to read the consent and click on  the agreement button if they agreed to participate. No information  revealing the participant  s identity was included or collected with the  survey. All completed surveys were then saved on password protected  Google forms that the researcher could only access and fill by every  recipient.  2.2. Data collection method  An online Google form was used to collect the survey data. The link  to the survey was distributed in all Jordanian cities through social media  platforms. The survey was designed so that respondents were limited to  providing one response per individual. The study was conducted in  April  July 2020.  2.3. Measures  The researchers used the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales  DASS 21   tool to explore mental health measures. The scale is a reliable and valid  measure of mental health  23 . DASS 21 was validated in different  countries during the COVID 19 pandemic  20 24 29 . Therefore  the  scale is a valid measure to assess mental health during the COVID 19  pandemic. The details of the scale have been previously described  thoroughly  30 . However  will be briefly described. Three emotional  conditions are measured with the scale  depression  DASS D   anxiety   DASS A   and stress  DASS S   each of which consists of seven items.  The DASS D scale is used to determine hopelessness  dysphoria  life  devaluation  self deprecation  inertia  and anhedonia among study  participants. The DASS A scale assesses the study participant  s auto  nomic stimulation  situation anxiety  skeletal muscle effects  and per  sonal experiences of anxiety symptoms. Lastly  the DASS S scale  examines the participants   levels of severe non specific arousal such as  irritability  nervous stimulation  difficulty relaxing  and impatience   30 .  The DASS 21 is a self administering scale where the respondents rate  the level to which specific experiences apply to them. The respondents  rated these experiences on a 4 point scale that ranges from 0  does not  relate to me  to 3  mostly apply to me . The researchers then calculated  the scores for each of the three scales by adding the scores for the  applicable elements. The totals of all three scales were then multiplied  by two to compare the scores to DASS 42.  The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Jordan  University of Science and Technology  Approval ID  225 2020 .  2.4. Statistical analysis  The SPSS version 24 was used to analyze data. The researcher calculated the descriptive statistics of means  ranges  standard de  viations  and frequencies to describe the intention to get tested  perceived barriers of testing  and demographics of the participants. The  ANOVA test was used to compare the DASS score according to age and  gender.  3.Results  3.1. Demographical characteristics  The study includes 1578 participants  Table 1 . The mean age of the  sample was 33.6  11.2 years. Participants were sorted into 3 groups  according to the age of participants  18 29  41.7    30 39  29.4    and   40  28.9  . The men represent about 30  of the sample. The majority  was from middle income  77.3   and worked in the governmental  sector  50.8  .  3.2. Distribution of participants according to DASS score  Table 2 shows the DASS scores of the participants. The mean  SD  DASS stress score was 13.2  0.27 while was 11.95  0.25 for depres   sion and 7.6  0.20 for anxiety. The total DASS score of the whole  sample was 32.7  0.67.  3.3. DASS scores based on the perceived probability of infection with  COVID 19  The participants were enquired about their perception of the possi   bility of getting COVID 19 disease. Most participants indicated low  probability  n  936  59.5    whereas 34.6   n  544  and 14.8   n   97  indicated moderate and high probability respectively. The DASS  scores  Table 3  show significantly high scores for stress  anxiety  and  depression in the groups that perceived moderate to a high probability  of infection with COVID 19  P D0.05 . The post hoc test indicated a  significant difference  P D0.05  between the low group and the high   moderate groups in all examined DASS score parameters.  3.4. DASS scores according to the gender of jordanian people  As in Table 4  the stress score was greater  P D0.001  in the men   11.39  0.469  compared to the women  10.74  0.33 . On the other  hand  anxiety and depression scores were higher in women than men   8.13  0.25  and 12.71  0.30 versus 6.48  7.88  and 10.24  0.420   respectively . In addition  the total DASS score was higher in the women  participants than the men participants  P D0.01 .  3.5. DASS scores according to age groups of jordanian people  A separate ANOVA  shown in Table 5  revealed that DASS total score  significantly decreases with the increasing age of the participants  P D Table 1  Demographical characteristics of Jordanian people  N  1578 .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100936 30.001 . The trend in the decrease of DASS scores was evident in all pa  rameters  i.e.  stress  anxiety  and depression . In addition  posthoc  analysis showed significant differences between all examined age groups   P D0.05  Table 5 .  4.Discussion  According to previous results from pandemics  e.g.  Ebola and SARS   outbreaks can cause uncertainties and fear. These negative psychologi   cal feelings are associated with experiencing depression  anxiety  and  stress which can trigger mental disorders considering  31 32 . This is the  first national study examining the mental health among Jordanian  adults using DASS during COVID 19.  The current study detected that stress score was 13.2  depression was  11.95  and anxiety was 7.6  indicating moderate to severe stress  mod  erate to severe depression  and mild to moderate anxiety. A previous  study showed that 16.3  reported moderate serious mental impact   16.9  experienced mild serious depressive symptoms  13.4  stated  experiencing moderate severe stress  and 28.8  experienced serious  anxiety signs  28 . The negative psychological scores reported in this  study were lower than those reported by Salari et al.  5 . According to  their research  Salari et al.  5  found that 33.7  of the respondents  experienced depression symptoms  31.9  experienced anxiety symp   toms  and 29.6  experienced stress symptoms. Studies in China showed  that the overall mean mental health score was higher than 24  which is  indicative of worse  or compromised  mental effects of COVID 19. The  authors concluded that the general Chinese population experienced post traumatic stress disorder symptoms during the pandemic  16 .  The current study showed that most participants  59.5   indicated a  low probability of infection  whereas 34.6  and 14.8  indicated  moderate and high probability respectively. The DASS scores showed  significantly high scores for stress  anxiety  and depression in the groups  that perceived a moderate high probability of infection with COVID 19.  In a previous study  respondents reported that they perceived lower  chances of contracting COVID 19 and more chances of surviving if  infected  28 . Besides  the respondents were self assured about the  abilities of their doctors  and the perceptions of the respondents were  protective against severe mental states  28 . The study also showed that  almost half of the study participants experienced at least one physical  symptom of stress  anxiety  or depression within the last two weeks.  In the current study  the total DASS score was higher in women than  men. Similarly  a survey study reveals that the COVID 19 pandemic  impacted the mental status of women more than the men  33 . In the  influenza pandemic  it is suggested that women experience reduced  social and emotional support and a high perceived threat to wellbeing   isolation  uncertainties  and anxiety  34 . A meta analysis that investi   gated depression in the community from 30 countries between 1994 and  2014 showed that point prevalence of depression was significantly  higher in women  35 . In another survey study  a preponderance of  depression  stress  and anxiety among the women was reported 28 . Yet   the study found a clinically significant relationship between the mean  total DASS score  p  0.04  and stress score  p  0.03  between women  and men  28 . Multicounty data also illustrated that 5.1  of the women  versus 3.6  of the men were depressed and 4.6  of the women expe  rienced anxiety versus 2.4  among the men  36 37 . Another similar  study showed an annual 1.7 fold more depressive incidences among  women than men  38 . A different study conducted on healthcare  practitioners revealed no differences between male and female doctors  in the scores  39 . The discrepancies between different studies could be  due to the type of used scale or the nature of the studied population.  The present findings reported that stress  anxiety  and depression are  higher among younger people  18 30 years old . Similarly  a study  showed that individuals aged 40 years have higher stress levels  compared to those below the age of 40  39 . The reason behind such  differences is that with aging  the probability of isolation  mortality  and  morbidity if they contracted COVID 19 increases  39 40 . At the same  time  people aged 40 and above within their entrepreneurial peaks  experience financial and emotional demands. Before the COVID 19  health crisis  a study showed that people aged 60 years and below  chose to retire early because of high stress levels and anxieties  39 .  Holmes et al.  18   showed that older adults and those with low incomes  are susceptible to poor mental health.  The present findings using the DASS scale report an increased risk of  depression during the COVID 19 pandemic. Hence  it is necessary to  implement management strategies to overcome these risks. Among the  proposed interventions is online cognitive behavioral therapy  CBT  that  has been implemented during the pandemic  41 . For example  a ran  domized controlled trial demonstrated the effectiveness of CBT in  improving mental health among COVID 19 patients  especially those  with a severe form of the disease  41 . In addition  CBT can be used for  treatment of psychiatric symptoms such as insomnia  42 . The cost of  implementing CBT can be significantly reduced using open source  learning platforms such Moodle  43 . Engaging psychiatrists and  mental health professionals to advise government on mental health  policies could be beneficial for developing a country specific interven   tion during a pandemic  44 .  The first limitation of this study is that it used the descriptive method  while studying the research variables. The questionnaire was also self   reporting  hence the possibility of social bias. As a result  it is recom   mended that future research use qualitative or mixed methods designed  to investigate factors influencing depression  anxiety  and stress in  COVID 19 testing to obtain a more in depth understanding of the phe  nomenon. Besides  functional neuroimaging can assess depression in Table 2  Distribution of participants according to DASS scores.

Finally  the impact of vaccinations  introduction on mental health and Jordanian views and attitudes toward  vaccinations are highly recommended in future studies  50 .  5.Conclusion  People around the world have experience pandemic uncertainties  and fear  which can exacerbate the feeling of anxiety and stress which  can trigger mental disorders. This is a large national study in Jordan  regarding mental health problems that include different health measures  during the COVID 19 pandemic. The study found that many Jordanian  experience moderate to severe depression  stress  and anxiety during the  pandemic. The results of this study will benefit decision makers in  establishing a plan to prevent the consequences of these mental  disorders.
