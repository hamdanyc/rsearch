This novel drug binds to a small pocket on  the switch II of Kirsten rat sarcoma by exploiting the mutation that occurs at codon 12 wherein glycine is  replaced by cysteine. However  this pocket is not only prone to cysteine mutation but other mutations occur as  well including at codon 13. These mutations have been reported to drive cancer in the lungs  colorectal and in  solid tumors with varying degree of expressions. Sotorasib is therefore only effective in a small group of patients  especially those expressing cysteine at codon 12  reminding drug hunters of the unfinished work. This study  employs computational techniques to understand the susceptibility of the mutated binding pocket to the binding  of Sotorasib. It was revealed that the binding affinity of Sotorasib to other mutations aside Cysteine was  significantly affected via the total free binding energies presented by the mutated complexes. Furthermore  the  quantum of energy contributed by the mutated residues except cysteine was significantly reduced suggesting the  binding of Sotorasib is enhanced in only cysteine mutated Kirsten rat sarcoma. Residual interaction network  showed Sotorasib in complex with the cysteine mutated protein presented the highest degree centrality  shortest  path betweenness  shortest path centrality and shortest path degree indicating Sotorasib controls more infor  mation flow within the cysteine mutated protein than in other mutations. Insight unraveled here will provide aid  in the development of pan Kirsten rat sarcoma inhibitory small molecules.    1.Introduction  Rat sarcoma  RAS  is one of the foremost human oncogenes with  approximately 27  of mutations occurring in human cancers  1 2 . This  subfamily of proteins is encoded by three genes  Neuroblastoma RAS  viral  v ras  oncogene homolog  NRAS   Harvey rat sarcoma viral  oncogene homolog  HRAS   and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene  homolog  KRAS   2 . These proteins serve as molecular switches which  cycle between an active GTP bound and an inactive GDP bound state   3 . The  ON  and  OFF  state of these proteins regulate multiple cell  signaling processes that control cell growth and differentiation  4 . The  regulative alternating process is tightly controlled by a diverse family of  multi domain proteins  guanine nucleotide exchange factor  GEFs  and  GTPase activating protein  GAP  whose catalytic activities speed up the  intrinsic activation and inactivation of the RAS proteins respectively  5 .  A loss in control of the regulation of the process therefore results in  deleterious effects. One of the major mechanisms by which they lose  their regulatory effect is through mutation  6 . The RAS proto oncogene has therefore been identified as a key driver in tumorigenesis  7 8 . The  different RAS isoforms has been implicated in different solid tumors  with KRAS being the foremost mutated  making it the most therapeu   tically targeted isoform  9 . KRAS mutation is implicated in 22  of  human cancers  9 . The mutations are mostly observed in pancreatic  cancers  61    lung  17    and colon  33    9 10  and are considered  the most common mutated drivers in human cancer  11 . Besides some  rare mutation observed at codons 13 and 61  e.g.  G13D and Q61H    80  of KRAS mutations occur at amino acid position 12  from glycine to  other residues such as cysteine  G12C  14    aspartic acid  G12D  36     and valine  G12V  23    12 . The expression of KRAS mutations can  differ distinctly across different cancer types. For example  the KRAS  G12C mutation is more frequent in lung cancer  44    while KRAS  G12D is the predominant mutation in pancreatic and colorectal cancer   8 . Initially considered as  undruggable    mostly due to the seemingly  lack of suitable binding pockets for small molecules  13   drugging  KRAS has become possible with novel molecules which mostly target the  KRAS mutant isoforms occurring at the switch II pocket  14 17 .  Notably  mutation at this pocket occur at residue 12  G12C  G12D    Corresponding author.  E mail address  soliman ukzn.ac.za  M.E.S. Soliman .

Though several small molecules have been  designed to bind this pocket  clinical trials have revealed they have little  influence on conditions where other mutants except G12C are expressed   19 . This has presented a challenge to drug developers wherein  developed small molecule inhibitors are only effective in a small group  of cases. As observed in the clinical trials of AMG510  AMG510   the  drug shows more promising results in NSCLC than in colorectal and  other cancers driven by KRAS switch II mutations  20 . This study seeks  to employ computational tools via MMPBSA energy calculations and  residue interaction network to establish the impact of mutation on the  binding susceptibility of small molecules to the switch II pocket of KRAS.  2.Computational methodology  2.1. System preparation and MD simulation  The X ray crystal structure of KRASG12C with AMG510 bound  pdb  ID 6OIM   17  was retrieved from the protein data bank  21 . UCSF  Chimera was used to remove all nonstandard residues  22  except the  bound GDP and AMG510 while autodock vina  23  and Maestro  24   were used to perform all docking and covalent simulation preparation  respectively. The cleaned structure was saved in pdb format and named  G12C. Residue 12 of the protein was then modified to Ala  A   Asp  D    Arg  R   Ser  S   and Val  V  and the corresponding structures saved.  Residue 12 was then mutated back to its original amino acid Glycine  while residue 13 mutated to Cys  C  and Asp  D   and the structures  saved as well. These mutated proteins were then processed separately  for further docking. AMG510 was then docked into the binding site of  each mutated protein and the best pose with the highest docking score   most negative  saved for further processing. The complexes were saved  as G12C  G12A  G12D  G12R  G12S  G12V  G13C and G13D.  2.2. MD simulation of complexes  The G12C complex was loaded on to Maestro and preprocessed with  the protein preparation wizard  25 . The wizard was also used to cap the  termini with neutral acetyl and methylamide groups. Since a covalent  bond was formed between the ligand and cysteine 12  dabble was used  to create the input and coordinates files for further processing. The systems were defined by the FF14SB forcefield  26 . The atomic partial  charges of AMG510 were generated by using the antechamber module  which employed the Restraint Electrostatic Potential  RESP  and the  General Amber Forcefield  GAFF  protocol  27 . The LEAP module  incorporated into Amber 18 was then utilized to add additional hydro   gens to the systems  neutralize them by adding 9 Na and 1 Cl counter  ions and then solvate the systems  which were then suspended in  Transferable Intermolecular Potential with 3 Point water box of size 10     28 . The LEAP module was further used to create the input and to  pology coordinates for minimization  heating  equilibration and subse   quent production. With a restraint potential of 500kcal mol A2 to  include the solute molecules using the steepest descent  the systems  were then partially minimized for 500 steps and then fully minimized for  1000 steps with the conjugate gradient algorithm  29  without restraint.  The systems were then thermalized gradually from 0K to 300K using  Langevin thermostat and a harmonic restraint of 5 kcal mol 1A 2 while  using Berendsen barostat to keep the pressure at 1 bar. The systems were  then equilibrated by running 100ps MD simulation. The covalent bound  system  G12C  was further equilibrated for 5ns to stabilize the bond to  avoid breaking during production. Finally  production MD was run for  150ns with SHAKE algorithm  30  used to restrain all hydrogen bonds  using the graphic processing unit of AMBER 18. Trajectories and atomic  coordinates generated were saved for analysis.  For all the simulations  the CPPTRAJ and PTRAJ modules  31  in  tegrated in to the AMBER18 package was utilized to analyse the tra  jectories and coordinates generated from the production.  2.3. Binding free energy calculations  After the MD production  the snapshots were used to post process the  binding free energies by the single trajectory MMPBSA method by  employing the module incorporated in AMBER 18  32 34 . This method  was utilized because of its widely acclaimed efficiency  34 . The binding  free energies were therefore averaged over 150  000 snapshots. The  binding free energies were calculated as follows     G bind  Gcomplex   Greceptor   Gligand                                                  1     G bind  Egas  Gsol   T S                                                              2   Where  Gbind is taken to be the sum of the gas phase and solvation  energy terms less the entropy  T S  term  Fig. 1B.Sequence alignment of mutated KRAS at the switch II binding site.

Which is obtained using 1.4    water probe radius. Per residue decomposition analyses were also per  formed to estimate individual energy contribution of the residues of the  substrate pocket to the affinity and stabilization of the compounds.  2.4. Per residue energy decomposition analysis  Per residue energy decomposition method was performed using the  MM PBSA approach to estimate the significant role of interacting resi  dues  35  in ligand stable docking and was calculated as  Gresidue using  the equation below.    G residue   EMM   Epolar   ESASA                                                      The  Gresidue comprises the total energy computed from side chain  and backbone energy decomposition.  2.5. Residue interaction network  RIN  analysis  Inter residual interactions among the mutant proteins and between  AMG510 and the residues were carried out using the Cytoscape software   36  and its integral residual interaction network  RIN alyser plugin   37 . Averaged MD snapshot structures were used for each mutant to  create distinct interaction network profiles and subsequently visualized  with RINalyser. This was performed to ascertain insights into the dis  tortions in the interaction network caused by the mutations that could  influence the ineffectiveness of AMG510. The residues were denoted as  nodes  whereas inter residual interactions were represented as edges. In  the generated network profiles  the node degree for AMG510 in each  mutated complex were calculated which depicted the number of edges  connected to it within an undirected network. Also centrality measures  were also performed by utilizing the RINspector plugin  38 . This  involved AMG510 centrality  shortest path betweenness  shortest path  centrality and shortest path degree.  3.Results and discussion  In MMPBSA computations  the binding affinity of a ligand to a pro  tein can be calculated by evaluating all terms using separate trajectories  of complex  protein and ligand or by using only the snapshots of the  complex from a single trajectory  39 40 . The single trajectory is more  preferred because of the speed and its less demand of sampling because  all the intramolecular energies nullify when estimating the associating  energy  41 . We therefore employed the single trajectory protocol to  estimate the associating energies accompanying the binding of AMG510  to the different mutations that occur at the switch II binding site of the  KRAS protein. The total free binding energies of the mutant complexes  were tabulated and presented in Table 1.  These results showed that the complexing of AMG510 and  KRASG12C wherein a covalent bond is formed between the electrophilic  warhead and the nucleophilic moiety of the thiol sulfur of cysteine 12  is  more favorable and spontaneous with minimal kinetic obstructions  42 .  This is evident in the results displayed in which mutation at switch II  binding pocket to any other residue aside cysteine with a nucleophilic warhead result in significant reduction in total free binding energies.  Further observations of the computed energies revealed electrostatic  energy  van der Waals energy and the gas phase term contributed  favorably to the complexing of the systems whereas the solvent phase  opposed the complexing. However  the electrostatic energy contributed  significantly to G12C complexing compared to the other mutations  where van der Waals energy was the chief energy contributor. Again   aside the differential energy types contributions that characterise the  G12C and the other mutations  the quantum of energy contributions  reduced significantly among the energy types in the other mutant  complexes. Though significantly lower than the G12C complex energies   the van der Waals energies were observed to contribute higher to the  total free binding energies of the other mutants  contrary to what is  observed in G12C.  3.1. Per residue energy contributions  The total free binding energies of the complexes were further  decomposed into individual binding site contributions. Interaction be  tween a ligand and the binding site residues facilitate the binding and  stability of the ligand within the site  43 . As such AMG510 interactions  within the binding site would be crucial to its stability and subsequent  therapeutic effect. These take into account the energies that sum up as  the total free binding energy as tabulated in Table 1. Here  van der  Waals  electrostatic and the total energy of the mutated residues were  analyzed. This gives the opportunity to quantify the individual mutated  residue contributions towards the overall total free binding energy of the  complexing. The decomposed per residue energy were executed and the  mutated residue contributions presented in Fig. 2. As observed  the  cysteine residue that formed the covalent bond with AMG510 contrib   uted the most in terms of Van der waals  electrostatic and total energy  towards the complexing. Other mutant residues except 13D also  contributed favorably to the system complexing albeit in relatively  smaller amounts. As observed in Table 1  the major energy types  van de  Waals and electrostatic  that contributed to the total free binding en  ergies of the systems again featured as major contributors in the mutant  residues contributions underscoring their importance in the ligand  complexing.  These differentials underscore the varying effect of AMG510 on  KRAS driven cancers which is characterized by mutations within the  binding pocket as observed in clinical studies. Clinical trials have re  ported the redundancy of AMG510 in colorectal cancer  CRC  patients  driven by KRAS switch II mutations wherein only 1 participant  repre   senting 8  out of 12 participants achieved partial response whiles 10  participants representing 92  achieved stable disease  44 . This could  be partially attributed to the different codon 12 mutations expressed in Table 1  Energy profile of AMG510 in complex with mutations at KRAS switch II.

In CRC in particular  KRASG12C con  tributes only 12  to active cases whereas G12D  G12V  G12S  G12V and  G12R contributes 44   26   9   8  and 1  respectively  20 . This  trend is as well observed in pancreatic cancer wherein G12C accounts  for only 3   however its efficacy is well appreciated in lung cancer   NSCLC  where G12C accounts for 44  of cases  9 44 .  3.2. AMG510 exhibits great influence on information flow within  KRASG12C than in other mutations  Residue interaction within a protein network is critical in conserving  its 3D structural integrity which is crucial for its biological activity. A  disruption of this network could therefore result in dysfunctionality or  inactivation. Because proteins adapt to their environmental changes  including small molecule binding through conformational changes  this  study sought to further ascertain the impact of AMG510 binding to the  residue interaction and network topology of the KRAS  protein. Within a protein  s topology and network  the centrality and  betweenness are crucial metrics that determines the  star like   character  of a node which relies on hubs  45  and the frequency with which a node  occur in the shortest path length between any other two nodes  46   respectively. Dependence on hubs makes proteins more resilient against stray  attacks   such as amino acid substitution initiated by DNA muta   tions but render them more susceptible to drug targeted attacks  47 48 .  Therefore  hubs and betweenness  which is useful in identifying residues  that are important for the overall network integrity  are very crucial in  understanding drug susceptibility and designing of potent drugs.  As stated in the previous stanza  centrality is one of the important  metrics that indicates a residue or nodes star like performance hence the  exposure and opportunity to directly influence a network. We therefore  evaluated the role of AMG510 within the respective network topology of  the complexes and the results tabulated in Table 2.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100952 6AMG510 played a more central role in the 3D network structure of KRAS  G12C than the other KRAS mutants. The higher the value the more  connected the node to other nodes and the more essential it becomes in  the network  49 50 . This suggests the influence of mutations at switch  II binding pocket other than.  G12C on the therapeutic influence of AMG510 on the KRAS protein.  Results of other matrices of centrality corroborates this finding. Shortest  path betweenness which indicates the power of a node to broker or  control information flow within the network  51 52  showed the highest  value in KRASG12C as presented in Table 2. AMG510 also presented  highest values in shortest path centrality and shortest path degree when  in complex with KRASG12C than in other mutants suggesting the  prowess of AMG510 to control information flow within KRAS12C than  other mutations. The obstruction of information flow within the protein  network could prevent the recognition and subsequent binding of  effector proteins  53 .  3.3. System dynamic conformational stability  Prior to the analysis of the systems  the root mean square deviation   RMSD  of the c a atoms of the proteins relative to the starting structure  were calculated. This was to determine the extent of deviations that  occurred during the 150ns period of simulation. The matric is infor  mative on the system stability and convergence and as well give  credence to the insights derived from the systems. The results were then  calculated and presented in Fig. 3 below. From the results obtained  the  systems presented average RMSD values of 1.83    2.47    1.64    2.27     1.97    2.07    1.22    and 1.58   for G12C  G12A  G12D  G12R   G12S  G12V  G13C and G13D respectively. The exhibition of RMSD  values below 2.5   is indicative of stable systems which gives credence  to the insights revealed from subsequent analysis.  3.4. Interaction Landscape of AMG510 in complex with KRASG12C  To further understand the interactions that condition AMG510  s  differential activity within KRAS G12C  we visualized snapshots at the  beginning  1ns  and at the end  150ns  of the simulation. This offered us  the opportunity to ascertain the interaction types that AMG510 engaged  in with the binding site residues. As observed in Fig. 4  the ligand  engaged in interactions ranging from conventional and carbon hydrogen bonds to pi pi interactions. Lys16  Arg68 and Asp69 formed hydrogen  bonds with AMG510 at the beginning of the simulation while Lys16 and  Thr58 were observed to form the bond at 150 ns. These interactions  together with van der Waals  pi pi T shaped  pi sigma  pi sulfur and pi   cations underscores the favorable impacts of AMG510 within  KRASG12C.  4.Conclusion  This study was undertaken to compare eight modes of inhibition of  KRAS protein in order to gain better understanding on the underlying  structural dynamics of the mutation inhibition mechanism. This  approach has been successfully employed in many studies including the  study of HIV 1 protease mutational effects  54 56 . Conclusions in this  study are based on one PDB file that has been mutated computationally  due to computational cost and the absence of experimental laboratory  findings on the various mutations thereby limiting the sampling size.  The study also employed the RIN analysis on static structures generated  from snapshots taken during the simulation.  Currently  binding susceptibility of AMG510 to the switch II binding  pocket of the KRAS protein which is characterized by mutations remains  uninvestigated despite clinical reports of AMG510  s therapeutic effects  on only KRASG12C isoform. Herein  we employed different computa   tional approaches aimed at providing insights into the resistance of  other mutations except G12C to AMG510. We performed molecular  dynamics simulations with subsequent thermodynamics analysis using  MMPBSA and residue interaction analysis which provided useful in  sights into the resistance of AMG510 by other mutations within the  binding site. These insights revealed the mutations at the binding site  influence the binding affinity of AMG510 as a promising inhibitor in a  protein  s mutation environment. The formation of the bond between  12C and AMG510 influenced and enhanced the stability of the ligand  within the binding pocket therefore potentiating its therapeutic effects.  Total binding energy of KRAS binding site mutants decreased by almost   40 kcal mol from  88.15 kcal mol for KRASG12C and AMG510.  Decomposition of this energies into individual site residues contribu   tions revealed corroborative results wherein mutated residues except  12C contributed relatively small quantum of energy towards the total  free binding energy. Further investigations into the residue interaction  network revealed AMG510 in complex with KRASG12C engaged in more  Fig. 3.Comparative C   RMSD plots showing the degree of stability and convergence of the studied systems over the 150ns MD simulation time  A .

These results provide a framework to assist with the design of more  potent and highly selective inhibitors for the mutated KRASG12C pro  tein as a result with G12C mutation is more suitable to AMG510 drug.  Theses insights offer important information that can guide in the design  of small molecules that will exhibit pan inhibitory properties. With the  advent and rise in personal precision medicine  57 59   these insights  could also be useful in formulating specific drugs for the varying mu  tation incidences.
