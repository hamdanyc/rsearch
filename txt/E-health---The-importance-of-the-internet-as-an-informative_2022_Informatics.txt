The aim of this work is to  investigate patients with disorder of the female sex organ  malignant and benign  to examine their information  behavior about their diseases. The role and importance of the internet as an informative health application for  these patients in this context will be highlighted.  Materials and methods  This prospective cross sectional study was based on a survey of patients in Germany  during the Coronavirus disease  COVID 19  pandemic among gynecological patients from July 2020 to  November 2021. Descriptive statistics were calculated  and simple linear regression analysis was performed to  show correlations.  Results  We analyzed the responses from 1271 gynecological patients. 91.4   n  1162  had an internet enabled  device. Of these  over 55   n  644  go online with a smartphone. Only eight percent  n  101  stated to never  feel able to use internet enabled devices. In addition  almost 47   n  596  say that their attitude towards  internet enabled devices changed due the COVID 19 pandemic in a positive way. 82   n  1042  of patients can  use digital health applications. In addition  more than 82   n  1046  believe that the use of digital health  applications can have a positive impact on their disease treatment. Due to the COVID 19 pandemic  the attitude  towards digital health applications changed positively in 41.4   n  526 . More than 73  of patients  n  933   reported using DHAs more frequently. 76  of patients  n  966  use the internet as a source of information about  their gynecological health problem. Over 90  of them  n  874  regularly use the internet for this purpose. Over  73  of patients  n  928  state that the internet has become an important source of health information for them  since the COVID 19 pandemic. For gynecological problems  two thirds of them  621 928  use the internet as a  source of health information before consulting a physician.  Conclusion  The internet as an informative digital health application in gynecology is used extensively and is  widely accepted by patients. Mistrust of gynecological health information from the internet has diminished  because of the COVID 19 pandemic. Confidence in informative digital health applications from the patient  s  point of view has increased. The internet was seen as a helpful health information platform in addition to medical  consultation. More specialized research in the field of e health in gynecology is needed. This includes large scale  randomized controlled trials  economic analysis  and explorations of user preferences to increase the confidence  and usefulness of informative digital health applications in the future. The most reported benefit of the internet  as a digital informative health application was time independent use. The main obstacles were a lack of trust and  evidence of the lack of health information from the internet.    Corresponding author. Department of Obstetrics  University Hospital Jena  Jena  Germany.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100942 21.Introduction  E health encompasses applications that use the possibilities offered  by modern information and communication technologies to support the  treatment and care of patients  1 . Health care networking is carried out  with the help of modern information and communication technologies  at all levels of care  2 . Digitization not only describes the preservation  of information in electronic media  but also the networking of individual  data  3 . With the goal of data automation  analog data is to be replaced  by digital data in the next five to ten years  4 . The World Wide Web   WWW  plays an important role. For the German population  the  internet is the second most important source of information  alongside  public television broadcasters  for finding out about current events in  politics  business  and society  5 . Various search engines on the internet  are regularly used for everyday life purpose. Just like everyday infor  mation  patients often look for health information on the internet in the  case of health problems  those affected look for information on symp   toms  diseases  and treatment options. Patients receive health informa   tion via various digital knowledge platforms on the internet.  Dr.  Google   is a pseudonym for this  6 . The Internet often serves as an  informative digital health application because a source of medical in  formation is essential. Various determinants influence the information  behavior of patients on the WWW. This influences the doctor patient  relationship. Patients take on a more active role  7 . From the pa  tient  s point of view  there is a role change  from the ignorant to an  independent  well informed  as well as self determined and more  co determining patient  8 . The digital transformation in medicine is  also increasing expectations of the quality of care and the pressure to  succeed  better understanding of the biological basis of life  technolog   ical quantum leaps in computing and data storage coupled with ubiq  uitous access to data via smartphones  and significantly increased need  for sovereignty of patients based on increasing transparency and digital  communication. Patients read up on their symptoms before visiting their  doctor  9 . It is up to the patient whether and how they want to use  digital health applications as medical information support  10 . The  possible uses in the medical sector are practically unlimited and as a  source of information they are very popular with patients  11 . Since the  Coronavirus disease  COVID 19  pandemic  digital information from the  internet has gained importance in all areas of life. This trend was already  evident before the COVID 19 pandemic. But it accelerated this devel   opment and is also reflected in the healthcare sector  12 . The aim of this  work is to ask patients who were treated for gynecological complaints at  the University Women  s Clinic in Jena about their information behavior  based on their gynecological symptoms. In addition  the influence of the  COVID 19 pandemic is to be examined. The role and importance of the  internet as an informative digital health application for these patients  was analyzed. Questions about the general use of digital media and the  perception of e health were also examined and where the interviewed  patients obtained the information about their gynecological symptoms  and how they assess the trustworthiness of the information sources. In  this context  the role of informative digital health applications  in  particular the internet as an e health application  should be examined  from the perspective of the interviewed patients. Possible influencing  parameters  age  level of education  practiced professional activity  on  the information behavior of the patients as well as their application and  attitude to e health are to be evaluated.  2.Materials and methods  A survey of gynecological patients on the use situation of the internet  as an informative digital health application in the age of Covid 19 was  conducted. The responsible local ethics committee was informed and  had no objections to the study  Reg. Nr. 2019 1456 Bef . The paper   based survey was created by members of the Working Group Young  Gynecology and Obstetrics of the German Society for Gynecology and  Obstetrics  Arbeitsgemeinschaft Junges Forum der Deutschen Gesellschaft f r Gyn akologie und Geburtshilfe  kurz DGGG . To inves   tigate the identified areas of interest  a panel of experts designed a  questionnaire based on the EULAR recommendation Task Force Stan  dard Operating Procedures after individual literature research  13 .  Four areas were examined     1  the epidemiological data of respondents.    2  the basic use of digital applications.    3  use of the digital informative health applications.    4  internet as digital informative health application.  The aim of the survey was to shorten the interview duration to a  maximum of 15 min to keep the dropout rate as low as possible  14 .  The questionnaire was distributed to the patients as a paper ques  tionnaire. It was given to patients before they received medical treat  ment in our clinic. The treatment took place in the University Women  s  Clinic in Jena. The clinic is the largest and the only department for  gynecology of a supramaximal care provider in Thuringia. Participants  were informed that their data would be strictly confidential and anon  ymous. All participants gave their consent. The exclusion criteria were  pregnant women and patients under 18 years of age. Only fully  completed questionnaires were included in the subsequent analysis. The  paper based survey was conducted from July 1  2020  to November 15   2021. The study was conducted in compliance with applicable data  protection regulations and the Declaration of Helsinki.  The results were analyzed using Microsoft Office Excel 2021   Microsoft  USA  and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences   SPSS  Version 27.0  SPSS Inc.  Chicago  IL  USA . Descriptive statistics  included quantities  percentages  median scores  and ranges for ordinal  variables. Simple linear regression analysis was performed to show  correlations. For the correlation of variables to age or school qualifica   tion the Spearman test and Kruskal Wallis test was used. P values were  calculated using Mann Whitney U test. A p value of less than 0.05 was  considered significant.  2.1. Study questionnaire contents  A 22 item  a self administered paper questionnaire survey was  developed based on a comprehensive list of questions bases on the  published research in digitalization among patients. Members of the  Working Group Young Gynecology and Obstetrics  Arbeitsgemeinschaft  Junges Forum der Deutschen Gesellschaft f r Gyn akologie und  Geburtshilfe  DGGG  were invited for the validation process to provide  feedback on question format  comprehensiveness  clarity  and flow  15 .  According to this  the questionnaire was refined. The survey was pilot  tested to ten patients to gauge the need to refine wording and format and  to check whether the predefined response options were exhaustive.  Minor revisions were made. Accordingly  the questionnaire was modi   fied. It consisted of binominal questions and questions in categoric  Likert scales and open ended questions.  3.Results  3.1. Overview  From July 2020 to November 2021  a cross sectional  self completed   paper based survey on the acceptance  use  and barriers of the internet  as an informative digital health application was conducted among pa  tients with gynecological diseases in Germany in the times of SARS CoV   2.  3250 patient questionnaires were distributed. Of these  2013  62    were completed. Of these 2013  742  23   were excluded from the  analysis because not all questions were answered. The final response  rate for patients was 39   1271 3250 . In the period from July 2020 to  November 2021  we treated in our department more than 21.000 pa  tients due to a gynecological disease. 1271 21.000  6.1   patients were S. Hertling et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100942 3participated in the study.  3.2. Respondent demographics  One thousand two hundred and seventy one patients participated in  the survey. Two age peaks are represented  32.4   n  412  aged 31 40  years and 29.1   n  370  aged 51 60 years. The mean age of the  participating patients was 42.8 years  14.1  Fig. 1 . The majority were  female  n  1258  99  . Myoma  n  343  27   and endometriosis  n   305  24   are the most common diseases  Fig. 2 . Patients were  admitted to one category of disease.  3.3. Level of education  The school leaving certificate was queried and the classification ac  cording to Abitur  secondary school certificate and secondary school  certificate as well as no certificate was requested. When asked about the  level of education  750  59   of respondents said they had an inter  mediate secondary school certificate. 27   n  343  of them had a lower  secondary school certificate. 4   n  51  of patients did not have a  school leaving certificate. 10   n  127  of respondents had a high  school certificate. Basic use of digital applications A proportion of 91.4    n  1162  of the gynecological patients stated that they had an internet   enabled device. Of these  over 55   n  644  go online with a smart   phone. 270 patients  23.2   prefer to go online with a tablet. Almost  20  of respondents  n  248  prefer a PC or laptop and other internet   enabled devices. Almost 70   n  885  of participants feel able to use  internet enabled devices. Only 8   n  101  stated to never feel able to  use internet enabled devices. In addition  almost 47   n  596  say that  their attitude towards internet enabled devices changed due the COVID   19 pandemic in a positive way. When asked how often the respondents  used their internet enabled devices since the COVID 19 pandemic in the  year 2020  almost 70   n  873  answered several times a day. Only 6    n  82  said they had never used internet enabled devices since the  COVID 19 pandemic  Table 1 .  3.4. Digital health applications  DHAs   knowledge and use  82   n  1042  of patients can use DHAs. In addition  more than  82   n  1046  believe that the use of DHAs can have a positive impact  on their disease treatment  while almost 12   n  147  disagreed. Due  to the COVID 19 pandemic  the attitude towards DHAs changed posi  tively in 41.4   n  526 . More than 73  of patients  n  933  reported  using DHAs more frequently  Table 2 . The higher the age of the pa  tients  the lower the overall app usage  p D0.001  and the lower the  patients   confidence in using apps  p D0.001 . No significant difference  in school qualifications was found  p  0.345 . 3.5. Internet as digital informative health application  76  of patients  n  966  use the internet as a source of information  about their gynecological health problem. Over 90  of them  n  874   regularly use the internet for this purpose. Patients were asked how  trustworthy they rated health information from the internet on a scale of  1 6  with 1 being not trustworthy and 6 being very trustworthy. The  patients rated the trustworthiness at an average of 4.6. There were no  significant differences in the age groups  p  0.218  or the different  school qualifications  p  0.324 . Patients were asked how helpful they  found the health information from the internet on a scale of 1 6  with 1  being unhelpful and 6 being very helpful. The patients rated the type of  help with an average of 4.9. There were significant differences in the age  groups  p D0.001 . The younger the patients were  F41 years   the  more helpful the health information from the internet was rated. When  asked whether school leaving qualifications changed perceptions of the  value of online health information  there was no significant difference in  the usefulness of online information in the groups with different school   leaving qualifications  p  0.474 . Over 73  of patients  n  928  state  that the internet has become an important source of health information  for them since the COVID 19 pandemic. For gynecological problems   two thirds of them  621 928  use the internet as a source of health in  formation before consulting a physician.  3.6. Conformity of gynecological health information from the internet  with specialists  When asked whether the online information on gynecological health  issues matched that of the specialist  gynecologist  there was an  agreement of around 64  for all age groups under 60 years. In the over  60s  agreement was only 28  and did not reach significance  p   0.149 . When asked whether the information from the internet matched  the information from the medical specialist for the various school de  grees  the highest degree of match was found in patients with the Abitur   82   104 127   followed by the secondary school leaving certificate   69   518 750   the lower secondary school certificate  52   179 343   and finally no school certificate  45   23 51 . There were no significant  differences  p  0.263 .  4.Discussion  4.1. Main results  The aim of the study was to assess the availability and subjective  patient value of online gynecological health information and its con  sistency with the information provided by the specialist. In addition  it  was investigated how trustworthy the health information on  Fig. 1.Overview patients   age.  S.

The  internet was seen by gynecological patients as a useful health informa   tion platform. It could be shown that internet capable devices were  available in 91   but less frequently with increasing age and decreasing  schooling. The continued growth of the internet has given patients easy  access to medical information  regardless of age or school qualification.  The internet plays an essential role in the search for information by  patients with gynecological symptoms. A survey by the European  Commission in 2014 showed that the internet is even more important as  a search medium for information  Here  57  of Germans have used the  internet in the past twelve months to find out about health topics. This  puts Germany slightly below the European average of 59   16 . In this  study  more than two thirds of patients reported using the internet as a  source of information. In recent years  the importance of the internet from a patient  s point of view has steadily increased. It therefore has a  direct impact on the health system  17 . There are many reasons for the  growth in internet use on health care issues. One reason for this may  include a lack of alternatives for patients. Other sources of information  on health issues such as books pose a barrier and are less accessible from  the patient  s point of view  18 . For most patients  information from  specialist sources is often misleading or incomprehensible due to the  specialist terminology used. As a result of this difficult accessibility   trustworthy websites for medical research have so far not been able to  establish themselves for the group of patients  19 . In a study by  Ayantunde et al. 70  of the patients reported using internet search  engines as the first point of contact for health issues  20 . Patients often  receive medical information on social media. Serious websites for  medical research have not yet been established due to this difficult  accessibility  19 . In addition to health search engines and lexicons for  looking up specific topics  private companies  hospitals  and medical  practices also make their information available on their own homepages   21 . The internet has become one of the most important sources of  information on health issues from a patient  s point of view  alongside  family and specialist doctors  magazines  and television  22 . The age of  the respondents plays an important role here. This study showed that for  older patients over 60 years of age  the internet is an important source of  Fig. 2.Overview Patients diagnosis in percent.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100942 5information for gynecological health issues. This point is controversially  discussed in the literature. In a study by Baumann et al. it was found that  the older the patients were  the lower the likelihood that they obtained  health information via the internet  23 . However  other studies show  that older people are increasingly using the internet as a health infor  mation medium. In the US  the number of older users of health infor  mation is increasing from 24.8  in 2009 to 43.9  in 2018  24 . In the  study by Hung et al.  other influencing factors were described in addi  tion to age. Patients with higher education  a higher income or a high  socioeconomic status are increasingly using the internet as a source of  information about their health  24 . In the present study  the school  qualification did not show any significant influence on the retrieval of  health information from the internet in gynecological patients.  4.2. Effects in everyday clinical practice  Today  many patients inform themselves about their health problems  before visiting the doctor and use the internet as a source of information   25 . In our study  more than two thirds of patients search the internet  for health information about their gynecological symptoms before  visiting a doctor. Providing information before visiting a doctor or clinic  can influence the doctor patient relationship. As in the past  patients no  longer merely assume the role of the layman  but have more opportu   nities to get involved in the conversation thanks to the advance infor  mation  26 . Patients also felt able to participate competently in  decisions after searching for information  27 . Patients are thus guar  anteed a certain emancipation. They feel less blindly trusting the advice  of doctors and can question decisions. Meanwhile  almost a third of  patients inform themselves about their medical condition prior to the  doctor s visit  but do not tell doctors about it  28 . Another study shows  an even higher turnout  89  of respondents said they had informed  them about health issues questions on the internet in the last twelve  months. Physicians therefore deal primarily with patients who are  already informed  23 . In this study  more than two thirds of patients  search the internet for health information about their gynecological  symptoms before visiting a doctor. The dissatisfaction of patients after  contact with a doctor plays a major role  According to Baumann and  Czerwinski  dissatisfied patients are more likely to search for informa   tion on the internet  23 . One reason may be the understanding barrier  between the patient and the doctor. Despite previously informed pa  tients  even after a visit to the doctor  they feel that they are insuffi   ciently or poorly informed  29 . This could be due to the lack of  conformity of health information from the internet with specialists.  When asked about the correspondence between the information found  online on gynecological health issues and that of the specialist  gyne   cologist   there was an agreement of around 64  for all age groups  under 60. Over 60 the agreement was only 28 . For the various  school leaving qualifications  the correspondence for patients with high  school diplomas was higher as for the patients with a lower school  qualification. These results of the study show a connection between the  factors age and school leaving certificate in relation to conformity of  gynecological health information from the internet with specialist doc  tors  without showing any significant statistical results. The role rela  tionship between doctor and patient is also changing. By using the  internet  the patient can obtain information on health issues before  medical treatment and  by obtaining information on the internet  make a  concrete decision with the specialist. The patient becomes the coordi   nator and manager of their own test results and medical records. From  the patient s point of view  this results in a role change  from the igno  rant to an independent  well informed  as well as self determined and  co determining role  30 . The communication skills of the specialist also  play a major role in the subjective assessment of patients.  Patient oriented communication often plays a minor role in medical  education  and this can also lead part to the discrepancy between the  information  31 .  There are no surveys of how reliable and helpful the information from the specialists is from the patient s point of view. Patients in this  study were asked how trustworthy they considered health information  from the internet. The patients rated the trustworthiness at an average of  4.6 6.0. There were no significant differences in the age groups or the  different school qualifications. In comparison with other studies  the  results are similar. Although there has been criticism of the more readily  available online information  which is often viewed as skewed  incom   plete  or inaccurate  patients trust this information and find it helpful   32 . The patients in our study answered the question of whether health  information from the internet is considered helpful with an average of  4.9 out of 6 points. Patients under 60 years of age in particular rate the  information better than patients over 60 years of age. This age related  difference could disappear in the next few years as these younger pa  tients grow up with the internet and become the future older population   33 . It is also unclear whether this subjective perception is correctly  reproduced. This is influenced by the quality of the information avail  able online and whether patients without medical training can filter out  misinformation at all  34 .  4.3. Influence of COVID 19 pandemic  The COVID 19 pandemic has a positive impact on the use of e health.  Various studies show this development. In this way  the internet is used  by more people and at the same time more frequently. Events or pro  cesses take place in digital space. This is also the case in health care.  Patients have been using digital health applications more frequently  since the COVID 19 pandemic  35 . This development was also evident  in the data from this study. The surveyed gynecological patients use  digital health applications. For gynecological patients  the internet has  played an important role in health issues since the COVID 19 pandemic   so over two thirds of them use the internet as the first point of contact  with gynecological symptoms before they see a doctor. Comparable  study results for this question are pending  but from the point of view of  gynecologists  digital health applications like telemedicine have played  a greater role for them since the corona pandemic than they did before  the pandemic. Most of the surveyed gynecologists find the use of digital  health applications helpful for the care of patients with gynecological  complaints  36 .  4.4. Limitations  The strengths of the study are the high number of participants  the  concrete examination of the internet behavior of the patients and the  appreciation also compared to the specialist. The limitations of the study  were that an objective evaluation of the information on the internet was  not possible. In addition  quickly only female patients answered the  questionnaire. This study only applies to patients with gynecological  clinical pathologies. Therefore  the effect of examining the influence of  internet information cannot be extrapolated to other symptoms. There  may have been a selection bias in the selection of patients because pa  tients without internet experience participate less.  5.Conclusion  The internet is playing an increasingly important role in finding  health information from the patient s perspective. The internet as an  informative digital health application in gynecology is used intensively  and accepted by patients. Mistrust of gynecological health information  from the internet has decreased due to the COVID 19 pandemic. In  recent months  the importance of the internet from the patient s point of  view has steadily increased. It impacts healthcare in a multidirectional  manner to combine different treatment options and locations. The  internet can serve as a digital health information application for gyne  cological patients. Various factors like age and school graduation can  influence the information behavior of gynecological patients. Further  research in this area is still pending and should be supplemented by S.
