Several dengue cases  combined with the current COVID 19 pandemic  exacerbates this problem. Two proteins  NS5 methyltransferase  and NS2B NS3 primary protease complexes  are crucial for dengue viral replication and are the target sites for  antiviral development. Thus  this study screened published literature and identified 162 marine fungus derived  compounds with active bioavailability. Following Lipinski  s rules and antiviral property prediction  41 com  pounds were selected for docking with NS5 methyltransferase and NS2B NS3 protease  PDB ID  6IZZ and 2FOM   to evaluate compounds that could stop the action of dengue viral protein complexes. To find the best candidates   computational ADME  toxicity  and drug target prediction were performed to estimate the potential of the multi   targeting fungal derived natural compounds. Analyzing the result from 41 compounds  Chevalone E   13.5 kcal   mol   Sterolic acid   10.3 kcal mol  showed higher binding energy against dengue NS2B NS3 protease   meanwhile  Chevalone E   12.0 kcal mol   Brevione K   7.4 kcal mol   had greater binding affinity against NS5  methyltransferase. Consequently  this study suggests that Chevalone E is an effective inhibitor of NS5 methyl   transferase and NS2B NS3 protease. Ligand based virtual screening from DrugBank was utilized to predict  biologically active small compounds against dengue virus NS2B NS3 major protease and NS5 methyltransferase.  Both licensed medications  estramustine  DB01196  and quinestrol  DB04575   were found to be similar to  Chevalone E  with prediction scores of 0.818 and 0.856  respectively. In addition  cholic acid  DB02659   aci  tretin  DB00459   and mupirocin  DB00410  are similar to Sterolic acid  zidovudine  DB00495   imipenem   DB01598   and nadolol  DB01203  are similar to Brocazine A  and budesonide  DB01222  and colchicine   DB01394  are related to Brevione K. These findings suggest that these could be feasible dengue virus treatment  options  meaning that more research is needed.    1.Introduction  Dengue virus  DENV  fever is the most common arthropod borne  viral disease in humans  affecting more than half of the world  s popu   lation  1 . DENV of the Flaviviridae family is ubiquitous and has been  reported in 953 476 cases in 2021  2   the majority of which originated  in Brazil  Peru  Vietnam  France  and the Philippines. Despite the significant disease burden caused by DENV  there is no approved anti  viral therapy or vaccine that can be used to treat or prevent infection   3 . The DENV genome is formed of 11 kb single stranded positive sense  RNA that is structured as 50NCR CprM E NS1 NS2A NS2B NS3 N   S4A NS4B NS5 30NCR  where NCR is the noncoding region  C is the  capsid  prM is the pre membrane  E is the envelope  and NS is the  nonstructural protein. Among these proteins  envelope glycoprotein    Corresponding author.    Corresponding author.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100932 4NS3 protease  NS3 helicase  NS5 methyltransferase  and NS5  RNA dependent RNA polymerase have been proposed as potential  therapeutic targets for dengue fever  4 .  Antiviral research currently focuses on key viral enzymes associated  with infection progression by inhibiting their biological activity directly  or indirectly or by preventing the viral reproduction mechanism  5 6 .  Several studies have revealed that NS2B NS3 protease is one of the most  commonly exploited targets for this purpose  7 . In addition  flavivirus proteases  such as NS2B NS3  are required to initiate viral replication  with infectivity  4 . Furthermore  DENV infection is reduced by 80   when cells are treated with peptide inhibitors of these protease enzymes   8 . Presumably  in the case of therapeutic purpose  inhibiting viral  proteases is a well known method of avoiding viral infection. HIV pro  tease inhibitors are widely used in clinical practice to treat HIV infection   9 . Similarly  simeprevir  10  and sofosbuvir  11  have recently been  approved for therapeutic use against hepatitis C virus protease and have  also been established as the gold standard. As a result  targeting  NS2B NS3 proteases with drugs is a widespread technique for treating  DENV.  In recent years  marine fungi have been proven to be plentiful and a  potential source of novel bioactive natural chemicals. Because most of  these organisms exist in harsh environments  they can develop unique  secondary metabolites. Metabolites are thought to represent the chem   ical defense response of fungi competing for substrates  12 . The range  of natural chemicals produced by marine fungi suggests that some of  these substances could be used in clinical trials to develop anti infective  medications.  Our study focused on using fungal bioactive compounds with potent  antiviral activity against various known pathogenic viruses  such as  influenza  hepatitis C virus  and herpes simplex virus  and as potential  drug prototypes against DENV as a contribution to this global scientific  endeavor. Thus  in this study  we used a systematic screening method to  identify the top candidate for NS2B NS3 and NS5 inhibitors of patho   genic DENV. Furthermore  computerized absorption  distribution   metabolism  excretion  and toxicity  ADMET  were analyzed to predict  the potential of these multi targeting fungal natural compounds for lead  optimization and drug discovery.  2.Method and materials  2.1. Protein dataset and binding site analysis  X ray crystallographic structures of nonstructural  NS  methyl   transferase NS5  PDB ID  6IZZ  and NS2B NS3 protease  PDB ID  2FOM   were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank  PDB . Afterwards  active  drug sites of two retrieved proteins were predicted using the Computed  Atlas of Surface Topography of Proteins  CASTp  server for high   resolution crystal structures and binding pockets  13 .  2.2.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100932 6Discovery Studio  DS  Visualizer  and water molecules  original inhibi   tor  and ligand compounds were removed to upgrade the protein  s  structure. The required hydrogen atoms were then inserted  followed by  optimization to ensure structural stability. The final compounds were  then translated to PDBQT format using the AutoDockTools 1.5.6  software.  To prepare the ligand  we examined a wide range of natural bioactive  chemicals derived from marine fungi that have previously been outlined  in the literature  14 15 . Subsequently  162 compounds were enrolled  with ID numbers and chemical structures obtained from the PubChem  database  Supplementary Table 1 . We then refined the bioactive com  pounds based on molecular weights between 350 and 500  g mol . Next   the biological potential of the selected compounds was predicted using  the prediction service PassOnline server  16   which proposes the bio  logical activity spectra of the compounds using the SMILES files of the  structures. The likelihood of becoming active  pa  parameter was set to  paF0.3 for a better prediction against DENV. Finally  41 substances  were found to have antiviral properties. Then  each ligand  s SMILE file  was converted to PDBQT format  loaded into the AutoDockTools 1.5.6  software  and set up using the prepared ligand preparation tool for  docking analysis.  2.3. Active site prediction and molecular docking  For molecular docking experiments  we used the default procedure in AutoDock tools 1.5.6  17 . A grid box was created around the active site  of DENV virus NS5 methyltransferase and NS2B NS3 protease  as well as  2FOM and 6IZZ  with the help of a DS Visualizer. In addition  we set the  grid box at 40  40  40 points in the xyz dimension  which equaled a  grid box spacing of 0.3753  and fixed the coordinates of the x  y  and z  centers as 0.387667   6.969833  and 12.141667 for NS2B NS3   meanwhile   15.658143   19.544214  and 38.773643 for NS5. We  employed the Lamarckian genetic algorithm with default parameters for  docking simulations  which included 10 genetic algorithm runs. Using  the DS Visualizer  we further investigated the molecule with the highest  energy ranking for protein ligand interactions.  2.4. Drug profile analysis of top compounds  Absorption  distribution  metabolism  and excretion  ADME  are the  four key criteria that determine drug levels and kinetics of drug exposure  in an organism  s tissues. These characteristics play a major role in the  pharmacological activity and performance  18 . The SwissADME server  was used to evaluate the ADME properties of the top five metabolites   19 . The blood brain barrier  BBB  in the examined substances was  calculated using the BOILED Egg model  20 .  2.5.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100932 7SMILES of the selected compounds that displayed predicted antiviral  activity were uploaded to the pkCSM server  21  and proTox ll data  bases  22 . The toxicity was predicted using the toxicity mode in the  pkCSM server  and the ProTox ll server was used to assess carcinoge   nicity and mutagenicity. By combining the molecular similarity  frag  ment tendency  and fragment similarity approaches  this popular server  effectively predicts numerous toxicity outcomes  23 . Based on the  analysis of 2 dimensional  2D  similarity to substances with a known  median lethal dose  the server also projected the oral toxicity  LD50 .  The list used for the prediction contained almost 38 000 different  chemicals with known oral LD50 values in mice  24 .  2.6. Prediction of drug target and available drug molecules from  DrugBank  The SwissTargetPrediction server was used to determine the poten   tial macromolecular targets of the therapeutic candidates  25 . Based on  a combination of 2D and 3D similarities with a library of 370 000 known  bioactive chemicals on approximately 3000 proteins  the server makes  predictions. Analyzing the homology screening of anticipated top drug  candidates  the SwissSimilarity web tools were utilized to find possible  therapeutic compounds against DENV virus NS5 methyltransferase and  NS2B NS3 protease. Using diverse methodologies  such as FP2 finger   prints  electroshapes  and spectrophores  26   the server allows  ligand based virtual screening of several libraries of small compounds to  locate authorized  investigational  or commercially accessible medications from DrugBank.  2.7. Molecular dynamics simulations  The iMOD server was used to analyze the structural dynamics of the  best protein ligand combination and to evaluate the stability of the  structure by applying deformability analysis  which included the  computation of the eigenvalues of the complexes  27 28 . This is a web  server that can be customized and can generate complex deformability   variance  B factor  covariance map data  and elastic network data. The  deformability of a complex or protein is determined by its ability to  deform at each amino acid residue  29 . The eigenvalue is equal to the  energy difference required to bend a particular structure  therefore  the  smaller the eigenvalue  the easier it is to deform the complex. The  eigenvalue also represents the stiffness of the protein complex  30 .  3.Results and discussion  3.1. Analysis of drug surface hotspot and ligand binding pocket  The drug surface hotspots of the selected NS5 methyltransferase and  NS2B NS3 protease with the ligand were investigated based on the  structural conformation of the docked complexes. The ligand binding  patterns as well as the locations of the interacting residues are shown  in Table 2. The positions of amino acids 127 161 were found to be  crucial for NS2B NS3 binding interactions  2FOM .

Additionally  CASTp was used to confirm the binding  site residues of the two target proteins.  3.2. The binding affinities of the ligands into NS2B NS3 and NS5 active  site  The results of docking details were recovered after docking all the  ligands with NS2B NS3 protease and NS5 methyltransferase target in  Table 1. The molecules that had the lowest binding energy of the  docking score were considered the best molecules and had a higher  binding affinity with the target receptors  31 . Moreover  the lower the  stabilization energy of ligand binding to the receptor  the greater the  potential of action was. To limit the probability of false positive results   the ideal binding energy of marine fungal derived compounds was  compared with that of the approved clinical chemical treatments  and  the binding energy in the screening criterion was amended to a negative  value F 5 kcal mol  32  to reduce the risk of false positive results. The  four best components are presented in Table 2  and the docking scores of  all the compounds are listed in Table 1. Out of 41 compounds  including  Chevalone E   13.5 kcal mol   Sterolic acid   10.3 kcal mol   Brevione  K   9.2 kcal mol   Brevione F   9.0 kcal mol   lindgomycin   8.7  kcal mol   Tetrahydroaltersolanol C   8.6 kcal mol  showed higher  binding energy against dengue NS2B NS3 protease  meanwhile  Chev   alone E   12   Brevione K   7.4 kcal mol   Brocazine A   7.1 kcal    mol   Brevione F   7.1 kcal mol   Sterolic acid   7.0 kcal mol   and  Speradine G   6.9 kcal mol  had greater binding affinity against NS5 methyltransferase of dengue virus. Contrastingly  Peaurantiogriseols  compounds  Penikellide A  Resveratrodehyde A  Remeremophilane B   and Engyodontiumone H showed the lowest binding affinity against  viral NS5 methyltransferase but had moderate binding affinity against  viral NS2B NS3 protease.  In the previous study  the in silico highest binding affinities of  Artesunic acid and Homoegonol against the NS5 methyl transferase re  ported as  7.2 and  7.1 kcal mol  33   which refers the slightly higher  binding affinity energy of our selected compounds  Chevalone E  Bre  vione K  Brocazine A  and Brevione F . In another study were revealed  that apigenin and luteolin phytocompounds showed the highest binding  affinity   7.7 kcal mol  against dengue NS2B NS3 protease  34  that  was dissimilar from our results we found more binding affinity  13.5    10.5   9.2 and  9.0 kcal mol for Chevalone E  Sterolic acid  Brevione  K  Brevione F  respectively. In addition   35  reported a lower binding  affinity for phytocompounds based on the binding affinity of the  above listed compounds. The ligand receptor interactions are shown in  Figs. 1 and 2.  3.3. Hydrogen bond analysis  The complex interactions between NS2B NS3 and NS5 with inhibi   tory ligands were visualized using a DS Visualizer  and a hydrogen bond  analysis was also performed. In the Table 2  the numbers of hydrogen  bonds and residues implicated in hydrogen bond interactions were  summarized. Chevalone E  Sterolic acid  Brocazine K  Brevione F  and  lindgomycin are possible NS2B NS3 inhibitor candidates with drug like  Fig. 4.ADME analysis of top four metabolites   A  Chevalone E   B  Sterolic Acid   C  Brevione K   D  Brocazine A.

At the  residues of SER127  LEU128  GLY153  and HIS51  Sterolic acid forms  four hydrogen bonds  whereas only the ARG54 residue was formed in  the case of Brocazine K. Moreover  Brevione F and Lindgomycin   GLY151  2.37  showed that they could also be used as NS2B NS3 in  hibitors. Contrarily  at the residues TYR838 and ILE717  Brocazine A  formed hydrogen bonds with viral NS5 methyltransferase. In addition   Sterolic acid had three hydrogen bonds interacting with the active site of  NS5 methyltransferase at residues ALA757  TRP803  and GLU509. Interestingly  despite the fact that Brevione K had a higher binding af  finity  this combination was unable to form hydrogen bonds. Therefore   Brocazine A  with two hydrogen bonds  was found to be the best in  hibitor of NS5 methyltransferase. The common interactions of the  examined compounds  when compared to the original inhibitor  suggest  that marine derived fungal compounds Chevalone E  Sterolic acid   Brevione K  and Brocazine A  Fig. 3  could be potential inhibitors of  NS2B NS3 protease and NS5 methyltransferase.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100932 103.4. In silico evaluation of drug likeness and ADME  The ADME approach was used to analyze the drug likeness of the top  four compounds found in the marine derived fungi. Forecasts were  made using the SwissADME database. The likeness of the drug was  demonstrated by five rules established by Lipinski. The molecular  weight  MW  should be between 350 and 500  g mol   the number of  hydrogen bond acceptors should be between  10   the number of  hydrogen bond donors should be between  5   and the Log Po w should  be between 5 and 10  36   with no more than one violation allowed.  Chevalone E  Brevione K  and Sterolic acid had higher gastrointestinal  absorption than Brocazine A. Furthermore  the BOILED Egg model was  used to compute BBB penetration  which demonstrated that none of the  top medication candidates tested had BBB permeation. Each compound  was water soluble to varying degrees  with Sterolic acid having the Table 5  Predicted drug targets for Sterolic Acid  Brevione K  and Chevalone E.

Toxicity  carcinogenicity and mutagenicity prediction  Acute toxicity  hepatotoxicity  carcinogenicity  mutagenicity   immunotoxicity  and toxicity targets were explored as the toxicity  endpoints. The results revealed that Chevalone E and Brevione K fell in  the category of toxicity class 4  while Sterolic acid and Brocazine A  showed toxicity levels of 1 and 3  respectively  the lower the class  the  higher the toxicity . The estimated LD50 for Chevalone E  Sterolic acid   Brevione K  and Brocazine A  were 1600  34  1255  and 75 mg kg   respectively. The toxicity characteristics in  Table 4  depict the level of  confidence in the positive toxicity results compared to the class average.  No unfavorable effects such as tumorigenicity  mutagenicity  irritation   or reproductive consequences were observed for any of the compounds.  3.6. Prediction of drug targets  available drug molecules from DrugBank  and molecular dynamics simulation  Molecular target investigations are required to uncover the pheno   typical side effects or possible cross reactivity caused by their actions.  This is the first step in determining the viability of using the drug in  future in vitro and in vivo experiments  37 . As a result  Fig. 5 shows the  top 25 findings generated by SwissTargetPrediction  38  for Chevalone  E  NS2B NS3 and NS5 inhibitor   Sterolic acid  NS2B NS3 inhibitor    and Brevione K  NS2B NS3 and NS5 inhibitor . The target sites that the  chemical could bind to were largely protease and enzyme  13.3   for  Sterolic acid  nuclear receptor  33.3   for Chevalone E  and enzyme   26   for Brevione K  Table 5 .  Ligand based virtual screening was used to predict biologically  active small molecules against NS2B NS3 protease and NS5 methyl   transferase of dengue from DrugBank. Estramustine  DB01196  and  Quinestrol  DB04575   both licensed medications  were similar to  Chevalone E  with prediction scores of 0.818 and 0.856  respectively.  Furthermore  the results revealed that cholic acid  DB02659   acitretin   DB00459   and mupirocin  DB00410  are similar to Sterolic acid   zidovudine  DB00495   imipenem  DB01598   and nadolol  DB01203   are similar to Brocazine A  and Budesonide  DB01222  and Colchicine   DB01394  are similar to Brevione K  Table 6 . These findings indicate  that these could be viable therapeutic candidates for DENV infection   implying that further research is needed. In addition  based on molec   ular dynamics modeling  the best complexes for NS5 methyltransferase   Chevalone E and NS2B NS3 protease Chevalone E showed satisfactory  eigenvalues with structural stability. The maximal eigenvalue of the  NS2B NS3 protease Chevalone E complex was 2.866006e 04  compared  to 7.701529e 05 for the NS5 methyltransferase Chevalone E complex   showing great flexibility and difficulty in deformation  Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 .  4.Conclusions  Currently  there are no specific treatments for dengue. Although few  studies have been conducted to develop dengue vaccines  this process  has a great deal to be accomplished. As a result  scientists are currently  looking for inhibitors to block DENV s key methyltransferase and pro  tease  NS5 and NS2B NS3  which are involved in viral replication  as  targets for next generation therapeutic development. On the contrary   marine fungi have proven to be a rich and promising source of novel  bioactive natural compounds and may be able to suppress viral NS5 and  NS2B NS3 activities. In this study  the primary viral protease was  docked against marine derived chemicals. In addition  drug like char  acteristics  toxicity  carcinogenicity  and mutagenicity were predicted  using in silico ADME analysis. Analyzing the results  our study suggests  that Chevalone E  Sterolic acid  Brevione K  and Brocazine A found in  marine derived fungi are the best NS5 and NS2B NS3 inhibitors. The  predicted drug based on the ligand estramustine  cholic acid  acitretin  colchicine  and zidovudine could be exploited and developed as an  alternative or complementary therapy for the treatment of dengue virus.
