The consensus dataset would be homogenous between healthcare  settings and can pave the way for scientific collaborations. Iran is the fourth endemic country for brucellosis in  the world. Despite its huge burden on society  the economy  and the environment  there is no agreed upon  minimum data set  MDS  for reporting this disease  and the data collected are rarely homogenous or directly  comparable.  Objective   To establish the brucellosis MDS that may enable homogeneity in data collection  data reporting  and  data exchange among various HIMSs.  Methods  A two step process  including an extensive literature search and a two round Delphi survey  was per  formed to foster consensus about the required data items. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS V22   SPSS Inc.  Chicago  IL .  Results  The final MDS platform of our study contained 134 items divided into five main categories of admin   istrative information  epidemiology  diagnosis investigation  complications  and signs and symptoms.  Conclusion  This study provided a practical MDS for brucellosis that can help collect unified and comprehensive  data for electronic health record systems  EHRs   disease surveillance  and registries  and easily integrate them  with other HIMSs. The developed MDS can promote the collaboration of policy makers  healthcare providers   and researchers to prevent  control  and manage brucellosis.    1.Introduction  Brucellosis is a significant zoonotic infectious disease  which is  considered a major concern for public health and global trade. It origi  nated from the facultative intracellular pathogens of the genus Brucella  named in honor of the physician David Bruce  1 3 . According to the  World Health Organization  WHO   more than 500 000 new cases of  brucellosis are annually reported worldwide  4 . The occurrence of  recurrent brucellosis also has risen  5 . Apart from being a physical  disability  it poses a huge burden on the economy  mainly in areas where  the economy relies on livestock  6 . While the total prevalence of  brucellosis has been decreasing in the last decade  it is still endemic in  some developing countries including Iran  5 . Iran is the fourth endemic  country of brucellosis  and this poses a serious public health problem in this country  7 .  Timely and responsive public health surveillance for zoonotic dis  eases such as brucellosis heavily depends on integrated interventions  from public health settings  hospitals  and animal related organizations.  These interventions necessitate a consistent  reliable  and interoperable  dataset across involved organizations  8 9 . The absence of an effective  health information management system  HMIS  hinders precise assess   ment of the actual frequency rate and distribution of brucellosis and  delays control efforts  10 11 . Accordingly  the enhancement of data  management strategies to improve the measurement of the real disease  burden and affect the results of interventions has garnered global  attention  12 .  Iran s Ministry of Health and Medical Education  MOHME  has  decided to implement the Iranian electronic health record  EHR  project   Corresponding author.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100953 2 known as the SEPAS  abbreviated in Persian . A barrier to the extensive  adoption of SEPAS is the difficulty related to recording structured in  formation from clinicians who desire to document via free text clinical  notes  13 14 . The SEPAS system is fed by clinical data and reports from  broadly dispersed public health and hospital based systems including  hospital information systems  HISs   the Iranian integrated health sys  tem  known as the SIB project  abbreviated in Persian   and other related  clinical subsystems as the data input. However  the health information  systems in Iran are fragmented across different platforms  and integra   tion and interoperability between them are still challenging  15 18 .  Brucellosis  which represents a public health threat  highlighted the  need for a streamlined and consistent data reporting tool  also known as  a minimum dataset  MDS   adherence to EHR data standards  and  integration of data from clinical and laboratory sources  19 . The MDS is  a structured reporting framework in which healthcare experts them   selves decide on which data elements and criteria are appropriate for  being documented according to their competence and knowledge within  the specific domain to aggregate the use of data  20 . The establishment  of an MDS is a key step in developing an information system  21 . As  stated by Kowal et al.  MDS is a harmonious set of data elements used for  uniform collection and report  22 . Determining the MDS is a principal  and effective step in designing an information system that directly de  termines its failure or success  23 . Many studies have stressed the  importance of MDS for implementing national information systems and  supporting data exchange across health information sectors  24 25 .  Several studies have been conducted to standardize the reporting and  data exchange of infectious diseases  12 26 30   however  as there was  no established MDS for brucellosis within the healthcare system  the  current study aimed to develop one. Brucellosis MDS can guide clini  cians in structured reporting  improve patients   outcomes  and facilitate  further communication between healthcare organizations across the  country. It can also enable homogeneity of both data and their meaning  between various information sources.  2.Methods  2.1. Study design  The study was applied research conducted in 2021. A step wise  refinement method  including two steps  was carried out. First  a liter  ature review was performed to draft the preliminary dataset. Second  the  data included from the prior stage were analyzed using a two round  Delphi method with content validation by an expert panel.   1  Literature review  We conducted a literature review to identify the potential data ele  ments in brucellosis studies  reporting systems  and patient medical re  cords. To this end  first  a wide literature review was carried out in  scientific databases such as the Web of Science  PubMed  ProQuest   Scopus  Magiran  and SID to identify the data elements with the po  tential to be included in the finalized brucellosis MDS. The review was  conducted by using advanced search strategies and refining the results.  Studies were reviewed by keywords including   Core data element   OR   Core data set  OR  Minimal basic data set  OR  Minimum data set  OR   Minimum data element    AND   Zoonotic diseases   OR  Brucellosis  disease    AND   Information system   OR  Registry system    OR  Sur  veillance system   . The inclusion criteria were full text journal articles   conference papers  scientific reports  forms  and theses in Persian and  English  with the publication date ranging from 2000 to 2021. Any study  that investigated risk factors  diagnosing  prevention  treatment  follow   up  or any other aspect of brucellosis was included. Data elements were  extracted from the retrieved resources and entered into a checklist with  two administrative and clinical sections. In the second step  the medical  records of brucellosis patients at Ayatollah Talleghani Hospital affiliated  with Abadan University of Medical Sciences  Iran  were assessed  and relevant data were entered into the checklist. The sources were  continuously reviewed in this step until data saturation was achieved  and no new data element emerged from the sources.   2  Delphi phase  The initial data elements were validated by a two round Delphi  method as follows. Delphi is a well known technique for establishing an  expert agreement in a specific domain  31 . The Delphi method is an  iterative process whereby expert belief is transformed into an agreement  among experts  32 33 . Specialists are requested to fill out question   naires in several rounds. These questionnaires are completed anony   mously  and the collective results are shared with participants in  subsequent rounds  34 35 .  2.2. Participants  Participants for the determination of brucellosis MDS were experts in  infectious diseases  epidemiology  public health  and clinical laboratory  selected using purposive sampling. The selection criteria for the par  ticipants were having at least two years of work experience as faculty  members at universities of medical sciences  in Khuzestan Province   with research interest in topics related to infectious diseases  Table 1  shows the demographic characteristics of the experts.  Table 1  Demographic characteristics of the experts.  2.3. Ethical considerations  The director of the research facility of the university approved the  research protocol  ethics ID  IR.ABADANUMS.REC.1400.119 . All par  ticipants were required to sign a privacy agreement and study partici   pation consent form before joining the expert panel. We assured the  participants that their participation in this research was entirely  voluntary.  2.4. Questionnaire development  The initial literature review provided a working basis for developing  a questionnaire to elicit the expert panel  s individual opinions about the  essential data elements of brucellosis MDS. The importance of each data  element for the final MDS was judged by a two round Delphi survey. The  experts who participated in the survey were requested to assign a  Table 1  Demographic characteristics of Delphi participants.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100953 3priority value to each data element to be included in the brucellosis MDS  using a five point Likert scale. Based on this scale  a score of 1 repre   sented the  lowest level of importance   and a score of 5 represented the   highest level of importance  . The scores of every participant were  anonymous throughout the survey. Finally  the participants were asked  to propose new items that were not listed in the initial dataset for sub  sequent prioritization. The content validity of the questionnaire was  assessed by an expert panel  including two health information man  agement and three infectious diseases experts. Furthermore  a test retest  was made to evaluate the reliability of the questionnaire. The ques  tionnaire designed in our study is consistent with previously developed  questionnaires for brucellosis surveillance and registry systems in China   36   France  37   and Iran  10 . The proposed questionnaire contained  five sections  including demographic  clinical  disease and diagnosis   signs and symptoms   laboratory and evaluation  and disease compli   cations. The questionnaire initially had 380 items in Delphi  for each  question  five columns of  quite unimportant     unimportant     of me  dium importance     highly important   and  very highly important   with  a score of 1 5  respectively  were considered. At the end of each section   a blank row was provided to let the experts add necessary data elements.  2.5. Delphi survey rounds  After initial ranking  based on an item  s importance  items with  D60  agreement  average score of 3 out of 5  were deleted  those with  F75  agreement were excluded from the second round  and those with  a 60 75  agreement were surveyed in the second round. The checklists  were individually presented to the experts who were blind to the scores  of other experts  and if there was a 75  consensus over a data element  it  was included in the final MDS.  2.6. Statistical analysis  The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sci  ences software  version 25  SPSS V25 Chicago  USA . SPSS was used to  summarize respondents   characteristics and demographic details. The  mean was calculated for each item outcome. To rank the scores  the  mean for each item outcome was calculated. Statistical significance was  set to p D0.05.  3.Results  In the present study  after performing a literature review  data ele  ments required for reporting brucellosis were identified. The initial re  view in the selected database yielded 188 studies. A total of 122 studies  remained after removing the duplicates. Of them  18 articles  10 11   38 53  were finalized and identified as eligible studies after applying  inclusion criteria  including written in English and Persian  publication  date between 2000 and 2021  and document type criteria. Finally  the  full text of the articles was studied  and a primary data list was extracted.  The criteria for selecting the studies was to refer to the elements of  brucellosis reporting data in the context of information systems such as  registry and surveillance systems.  After searching scientific databases and studying patients   medical  records  we extracted a set of data elements and validated it via a two   round Delphi survey for inclusion in the final MDS of brucellosis. In  the first stage of the survey  the extracted elements were measured and  the experts   response rate to the survey was 100 . All the questions   100   were answered. The number of participants in the Delphi stage  was 34 individuals  of whom 41.18  were female and 79.41  had more  than 10 years of working experience. The mean age of the participants  and the mean years of work experience in clinical settings were 36.4    6.4 SD  and 15.66   4.5 SD   respectively  See Table 1 .  In this stage  all factors related to brucellosis were extracted and a  pool of data was formed. After preparing the initial pool of data  similar  data items were removed. A 380 items questionnaire was sent to the participants. In the first Delphi round  decisions were made about 380  items of the questionnaire. In this round  152 items were removed  while  100 items entered the second phase of Delphi. In the second Delphi  round  94 items were removed and six items were accepted. Finally   from the 380 items  246 items were removed. In the Delphi phase  the  Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction was conducted to reduce type I  error and ensure the accuracy of the answers  Table 3 . Finally  134  items were deemed important for inclusion in the brucellosis MDS   grouped as follows    1  Administrative data  This category includes 14 data elements such as  the patient  s name  identifier number  sex  religion  and additional  demographic data  Table 2 .  Table 2  Administrate data elements.   2  Epidemiology  This category includes seven data elements to identify  factors affecting brucellosis. These elements are related to the pro  cess of contracting the disease  progression of the disease in humans   disease outbreak  and intensification of symptoms. Data elements are  effective on the incidence and outbreak of brucellosis directly and  indirectly. We determined that the main epidemiology subclass is the  pathogenicity of Brucella species  modes of transmission  sources of  infection  classification of brucellosis  history  risk factor  incubation  period  and the onset of symptoms  Table 3 .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100953 43 Brucellosis signs and symptoms  This category includes 35 data ele  ments of common clinical features. It comprises the common signs  and symptoms of brucellosis  but the signs and symptoms of this  disease can vary depending on the organ involved  which we have  discussed further in the discussion of complications. In this study  all  common signs and symptoms of brucellosis were placed in this  category  Table 4 .  Table 4  Signs and symptoms data elements. 4 Diagnostic test  This category includes 26 data elements and com  prises diagnostic tests that play a key role in the diagnosis of  brucellosis and the impact of this disease on the involved organs. We  determined that the main subclass categories are laboratory in  vestigations and imaging investigations  Table 5 .   5  Complications  This category includes 52 data elements  comprising  all the complications due to brucellosis that can involve organs   Table 5 .  Table 3  Diagnostic tests and complications data elements.  4.Discussion  In this study  to adhere to data quality criteria in EHR  the basic data  elements were determined for reporting brucellosis. An extensive search  along with a two round Delphi survey was performed to determine  which data elements should be included or omitted and how the data  elements should be classified. The brucellosis MDS was designed in the  form of two main categories of administrative and clinical information  with five main data classes and 134 data elements. Due to the inclusion  of various non clinical  clinical  environmental  and epidemiological  data elements in the current MDS  it has extensive application in the  management of brucellosis at macro and interdisciplinary levels. The  MDS developed in our study can homogenize data collection in diverse  healthcare organizations  and improve data quality  brucellosis data  preparation  and investigation. Another benefit of the brucellosis MDS is  that it collects essential data in a standard format and allows them to be  directly collected from SEPAS  thereby significantly preventing human  involvement.  This study is the first of its kind that directly highlights the impor   tance of a brucellosis data collection tool. Kazerooni et al.  2018   concluded that developing a standard  integrated  and scientific MDS is a Table 3  Epidemiology class.

In another  study  Shanbehzadeh et al.  2022  designed a standard and customized  reporting template to provide interoperability between zoonotic dis  eases information systems  ZDISs  in Iran. They developed an MDS in  two non clinical and clinical sections with five and seven data classes  and a total of 38 and 57 data elements  respectively  12 .  Dong et al. reported that a standard brucellosis reporting template  improves data integrity  interoperability  accuracy  and reusability for  the patient care process  care quality  and research  55 . Rodr guez et al. also developed a hospitalization minimum data set  CMBD  to stan  dardize the documentation of brucellosis data in two clinical and  non clinical sections and seven data elements  including age  sex  the  type of residence  admission type  discharge type  length of stay  LOS    and cause of hospitalization  56 .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100953 7Shirzadi et al. also designed a uniform data template to efficiently report  the geographical distribution of brucellosis by age  place of residence   living environment  contact with pets  history of pasteurization  contact  history of infected people  and disease complications  51 . In another  study  Keramat et al. developed a registry system for recording re  currences and complications of brucellosis in demographic  history   contact and risk factors  signs and symptoms  and disease complications  classes for Iran  10 .  The data collected from one healthcare setting are reliable and valid  when they are consistent and comparable with the data collected from  others  57 . Inconsistent data items and diverse reporting structures  may impede the use of data for patient care and prevent data re use for  many other applications  58 . Furthermore  manual free text data  recording is a time consuming and error prone process. In contrast  a  structured MDS can provide a fruitful source to collect data features that  potentially affect the outcomes and allow for multivariable analysis to  determine the primary predictors of interest  particularly when these  variables are uniformly defined and collected  59 . The analytical power  of any study lies in generalizable and high quality data. When credible  and consistent data collection tools capture the data about a disease s  natural progress  researchers can plan their study more reliably and  detect eligible participants  60 .  We believe that the MDS developed in this study will be an effective  tool to collect higher quality data on brucellosis that may lead to better  clinical decision making. This dataset can guide future experimental  operational research on these unexplored areas which will be relevant to  decision making for brucellosis policy making. It would also allow  meaningful comparison of research results and objective assessment of  research population representativeness and potential bias. Further  the  need for joint analysis of data from diverse and multicenter sources  necessitates a certain degree of consistency and integrity in the data  collected. Besides  access to efficient  applicable  and feasible data  collection approaches may improve evidence based decision making   accelerate data sharing  and facilitate benchmarking between  organizations.  4.1. Limitations and implications for future studies  Interoperability is a salient feature of any health information system  that avoids redundant data entry and decreases the workload on clini  cians  61 62 . In this paper  the brucellosis MDS with a list of its possible  values was identified as a basic step toward interoperability and data  sharing between medical and research related information systems  regarding brucellosis. However  the template designed in the present  study can only meet the requirements of interoperability at the initial  level  machine portable data . It is  therefore  suggested that in future  studies  the maximum interoperability levels  machine interpretable  data  be met by standardizing the structure and content of the proposed  MDS. This requirement becomes even more important since maximum  interoperability is the main prerequisite for the effective implementa   tion of public health surveillance and registry systems.  Besides  forthcoming research should address the technical di  mensions of data sharing to computerized data pooling in the EHR. For  this purpose  widespread network infrastructure such as the internet of  things  IoT  with cloud computing involvement can be used for flexible  data exchange  without time and space constraints  63 .  Further extensions and modifications are essential  thus  conducting  an experimental study by including a supplementary Delphi phase to  improve the dataset is recommended. Moreover  this data template  should be assessed from the standpoints of a greater panel of experts to  be adopted nationwide.  The methodological strength of developing this MDS lies in the use of  an extensive literature review along with a stepwise Delphi survey  involving a multidisciplinary team. In both steps  the respondents were  ensured that they should choose only data elements that they perceived  as important for both clinical research and care purposes. We performed the Delphi survey to reach an agreement on brucellosis MDS. This  method has been proven to be fit for assessing information systems   necessities  64 . Still  one of its limitations is that most opinions are  marginalized. Despite the abovementioned limitations  this data  collection tool offers a homogenous and approved dataset on brucellosis  to accrue patients  so steadily larger cohorts will be obtainable in the  future. Furthermore  this dataset can collect generalizable variables  from multi center organizations and lay the basis for conducting an  exhaustive analysis based on machine learning  ML  methods about  many aspects of brucellosis. Moreover  it is projected to accelerate better  scientific partnerships for brucellosis.  5.Conclusion  The brucellosis MDS provides a standardized data collection tool   promotes data comparability across fragmented information systems   and enables combined analyses and meaningful assessments to respond  to clinical research questions. Further  access to efficient  applicable   and feasible data collection approaches may improve evidence based  decision making  accelerate data sharing  and facilitate benchmarking  between organizations. An experimental study including a further Del  phi step before implementation is advisable to refine some data  categories.
