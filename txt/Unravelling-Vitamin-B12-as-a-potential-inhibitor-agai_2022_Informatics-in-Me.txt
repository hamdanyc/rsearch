Lack of proper therapeutic man  agement has accelerated the researchers to repurpose existing drugs with known preclinical and toxicity profiles   which can easily enter Phase 3 or 4 or can be used directly in clinical settings. Vitamins are necessary nutrients  for cell growth  function  and development. Furthermore  they play an important role in pathogen defence via  cell mediated responses and boost immunity. Using a computational approach  we intend to identify the prob  able inhibitory effect of all vitamins on the drug targets of COVID 19. The computational analysis demonstrated  that vitamin B12 resulted in depicting suitable significant binding with furin  RNA dependent RNA polymerase   RdRp   Main proteases  Mpro   ORF3a and ORF7a and Vitamin D3 with spike protein and vitamin B9 with non  structural protein 3  NSP3 . A detailed examination of vitamins suggests that vitamin B12 may be the component  that reduces virulence by blocking furin which is responsible for entry of virus in the host cell. Details from the  Molecular Dynamics  MD  simulation study aided in determining vitamin B12 as a possible furin inhibitor.    1.Introduction  The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease  COVID 19  has been  declared as the global pandemic by the world health organization. The  world experienced a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019  COVID 19   caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2  SARS CoV   2 . It represents an unprecedented challenge to the medical sciences  as  the virus is highly contagious  1  and is mutating to different strains.  The first case was reported in December 2019 and it spread across the  globe through human to human transmission. During the past two de  cades  three outbreaks of coronavirus have ensued worldwide   i  severe  acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  SARS CoV    ii  Middle East  respiratory syndrome coronavirus  MERS CoV  and  iii  SARS CoV 2  2 . Coronaviruses are single stranded RNA viruses   ssRNA  with  26 32 kb in size and appear with crown like structure due to the pres  ence of spike glycoproteins on their surface. They are categorized into  four genera  Alpha      Beta      Gamma      and Delta     coronavirus.    coronavirus include SARS CoVs  MERS CoVs  and SARS CoV 2 and  can infect both humans and animals  3 . SARS CoV and MERS CoV have  developed mechanisms to reduce IFN production ensuing increased in  flammatory host responses  which produce powerful inflammatory cy  tokines  cytokine storm  and severe lung injury  4 . Cytokine storms  found in SARS CoV and MERS CoV infected patients correlate with  disease severity and poor prognosis  5 .  SARS CoV 2  also known as novel coronavirus  nCOV 2   encodes for  various structural as well as non structural proteins  facilitating viral   Corresponding author.    Corresponding author.

SARS CoV 2 encodes the  enveloped spike glycoprotein which is cleaved by furin proteases and  binds to its cellular receptor  angiotensin converting enzyme 2  ACE2   and stimulates membrane fusion and endorsements of the virus into  human cells  6 . The affinity of SARS CoV 2 towards the ACE 2 is much  higher compared to SARS CoV. Furin also known as proprotein con  vertase 3  PC3  is responsible for activation of SARS CoV 2 which may  be the reason for higher severity in terms of rapid transmission as  compared to SARS  CoV. PCs are responsible for activation of many  enveloped viruses. Hence  furin is considered as promising antiviral  drug target for several viruses causing severe infections. SARS CoV 2  encodes various nonstructural proteins  NSP   including mainly the  protease  Mpro   papain like protease  PL pro   RNA dependent RNA  polymerase  RdRp  and Nsp3 as largest protein encoded by coronavirus.  The structural and non structural proteins of SARS CoV 2 are promising  antiviral therapeutic targets  and their availability enables for  structure based screening of current drugs against them  7 . Various  studies have been already done on molecular docking based screening of  existing antiviral  antibacterial and other FDA approved drugs  8 .  Nanotechnology may be used to treat covid infections as green nano  technology has greater impact than conventional therapy nowadays and  shown diversified application in several research areas such as medical  sciences  pharmacy etc.  9 11   Gene editing technology such as  Crispr cas 9 technology can also play a role to combat covid pandemic   12 . Although to find a specific therapy for the recent pandemic of  COVID 19 is still on the way  a clinically approved antiviral drug or  vaccine is still being developed  the effect is yet to be confirmed against  the SARS CoV 2 medication both during and post infection. Several  drugs have been reported for in vitro activity against different corona   viruses. Drug repositioning may offer a strategy hence  many drugs have  been repurposed  including Remdesivir  Hydroxychloroquine and  Chloroquine  Umifenovir  Arbidol   Lopinavir Ritonavir  Favipiravir   Avigan   Oseltamivir  Tamiflu   Sofosbuvir  Galidesivir and Tenofovir  showed promising results for treatment of newly emerged strain of  coronavirus  13 14 . Other antiviral drugs including Ribavirin  Zana  mivir  Acyclovir  Peramivir and Ganciclovir which are commonly used  in clinical practice  are currently not recommended for COVID 19.  Molecular docking of selected phyto chemicals of nine medicinal  plants and network analysis  sequence and structure dynamics of key  proteins of coronavirus and human host has been reported by toluwase  and group  15 . Our group working in this area has reported through  immunoinformatics approach for immunogenic protein from the pro  teome of Leptospira and a codon based analytical study for susceptible  hosts of Nipah Virus  43 44  . The  repurposed   drugs that have been  approved by the FDA in the USA for other indications have been used  profusely to treat COVID 19 patients. Until a perfect treatment guideline  is available including treatment of co morbidities  one must switch to  suitable and balanced nutrition for appropriate body functioning and  enhancing of the immune system especially with the help of various  vitamins.  Vitamins  Vita  are the essential elements required for cell prolifer   ation  function and development. Moreover  they play a vital role  against the pathogens via cell mediated response and increase the im  munity. All the vitamins except vitamin C are reported for the antibody  production. Recent studies revealed that vitamins reduce the risk of  pneumonia and other viral respiratory tract infections  16 . The vita  mins also exhibit direct inhibition of viral replication or with immuno   modulatory or anti inflammatory means. Several vitamins  minerals and  herbs have a treasured effect on mitochondrial function. Vitamins are  essential nutrients as they serve a plethora of important metabolic  functions in the body. It has been well documented that the protection  provided by vitamins through the natural defence mechanism of the host  not only functions against infectious diseases  but also against cancer  and other degenerative diseases. The enhancement of host resistance to  disease results due to biosynthetic  antioxidant and immunostimulatory  activity. Direct antiviral action of some vitamins to protect against viral disease being inactivation of a wide spectrum of viruses as well as  suppress viral replication and expression in infected cells. One mecha   nism of virus inactivation can be explained that depends on the presence  of oxygen and production of reactive oxygen species  ROS  through the  Nrf 2 pathway  17 . COVID associated severe cases result in complex  biological spectacles  such as apoptosis induction  macrophage activa   tion  oxidative tissue damage and higher contents of pro inflammatory  cytokines  18 . The superoxide anion mediated pathways denote se  vere tissue injury for that drug with antiviral and antioxidant activities  may be the choice. Vitamins including B1  C  Ascorbic acid   D  E and  Omega 3  minerals such as magnesium and manganese and herb like  thyme play an important role on the innate system under the virus  infection  19 . Studies have suggested a possible role of vitamin C is to  combat COVID 19  20 . Moreover  along with vitamin C  Vitamin D  selenium also aids in COVID 19 management  21  Recent study reported  efficacy of ascorbic acid against COVID 19  22 . One more study sug  gests the need with the higher content of Vitamin C and Vitamin  B Complex micro nutrients to manage this pandemic successfully  23   24 . The group of vitamin B has a prime role for the immune response to  antigen as well  some of the water soluble vitamins act as a coenzyme in  the body for certain biochemical reactions to enhance the immune  system. Thiamine  also known as Vitamin B1 has a role in B and T cell  production. Riboflavin  B2  in combination with UV hinders DNA  replication in MERS CoV. Hence it may have a role in SARS  CoV pre  vention. Nicotinamide  vitamin B3  is the building block of NAD    which acts as a coenzyme in various metabolic pathways. Hence  it plays  a significant role in the inflammatory response and prevents lung tissue  damage. Pyridoxal 5  phosphate is the active form of vitamin B6 and is  involved in carbohydrate  protein and lipid metabolism. BAN  vitamin  B6 derived bananin  inhibits the SARS helicase enzyme  which hinders  the viral replication process. Vitamins B6  B12  and B9  folic acid   proliferate the activity of natural killer cells  which offers a significant  antiviral effect. Vitamin B12 inhibits the RNA dependent RNA poly  merase  which leads to the SARS CoV 2 viral replication. In a nutshell   vitamin B complexes have the potential to frontier the complications  associated with COVID 19 infection  25 .  2.Materials and methods  2.1. Retrieval of vitamin structures  In total  15 molecular structures of vitamins were retrieved from the  PubChem database  Table S1 . The three dimensional structure of the  molecules was downloaded in SDF format and the molecules whose only  two dimensional structures were available  were converted into their  three dimensional structure using Marvin Sketch and the best confir   mation obtained is minimised in semi empirical PM3 method using  Polak Ribeire algorithm in Hperchem Student evaluation version. The  minimised structure is then converted to pdbqt by AutoDock Tools  26 .  2.2. Protein preparation  The high resolution three dimensional X ray crystal structures of the  target proteins of COVID 19 retrieved from protein data bank  PDB    http   www.rcsb.org    using their accession IDs 6LU7  main pro  teases   6M71  RdRp   6VXX  spike protein   6W6Y  NSP3   6W37   ORF7a  6XDC  ORF3a  and Human proprotein convertase furin 5JXG  respectively. The selected target proteins were prepared for docking  using AutoDockTools 1.5.6  26 . The structures were saved in PDBQT  format.  2.3. Molecular docking study  The binding affinity of each vitamin compound with the SARS Cov 2  structural and non structural targets was determined by molecular  docking method. The molecular docking was performed using blind M.

The grid box is outsized  enough to cover the entire protein structure to encounter any probable  protein ligand interactions. The binding poses were clustered and  ranked in the order of their binding affinities. The molecular in  teractions  hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between the  target proteins and compounds were studied using LigPlot  version  1.4.5  28 .  2.4. Molecular dynamics simulation study  A molecular dynamic  MD  simulation of the Furin Vitamin B12  complex was performed using Schrodinger  s Desmond module. Molec   ular dynamics simulations of these compounds was run for 100 ns  ns .  In the beginning  the furin vitamin B12 complex was prepared using the  Schrodinger suite  s Protein Preparation Wizard with default settings  that included hydrogen atom and bond reassignment  addition of  missing side chain atoms of amino acid residues  optimization of loops  residues  and water orientation sampling at pH 7.4.

After achieving a state of equilibrium  an  unrestrained production phase with NPT  constant atoms  pressure  and  temperature  ensemble was developed for 100 ns under the supervision  of a Nose  Hoover thermostat  300 K  relaxation time  1 ps  and an  isotropic Mar tyna  Tobias  Klein barostat  1.01325 bar  relaxation time   2 ps . The smooth particle mesh Ewald  PME  approach with the  RESPA integrator was used to evaluate short range interactions  cut off   9 A  and long range Coulomb interactions. At a 5 ps period  the frames  capturing the system  s dynamic motions were exported. Plotting histo  grams for root mean square deviation  RMSD   root mean square fluc  tuations  RMSF   Hydrogen bond analysis was used to investigate the  system  s stability  29 .  3.Results and discussion  3.1. Molecular docking of vitamins with COVID 19 drug targets  In this study  vitamins were docked against non structural proteins   NSP3  NSP5  ORF7a  NSP12 and ORF3a   structural spike protein and  one host protease furin. Since the presence of furin cleavage site  PRRA  motif  in the spike has been confirmed  30   researchers are engaged in  looking for a satisfactory mechanism to explain the importance of furin  activity in spike maturation thus viral infectivity. Furin was shown to  facilitate virus entry into the cell after receptor binding for other coronaviruses  e.g.  MERS CoV. Furin is generally membrane bound  but  an active isoform has been described that can be secreted  potentially  facilitating cleavage of the SARS CoV 2 spike protein in the cellular  neighbourhood. Realising the important role of this host protease in  spike activation we have also targeted the protein for inhibitor binding  that resulted with a very exciting outcome. The arrangement of the  binding mode of the ligands is considered mainly based on the positions  of hydrogen bond interaction with protein and minimum binding en  ergy. Amongst all molecules vitamin B12  vitamin D3 and vitamin B9  exhibited good affinity  and vitamin B15 showed strong interaction in  terms of H bonds. Table 1 illustrates binding energies of all vitamins  with target protein of SARS CoV 2.  3.1.1. Vitamin B12 and B9 had the strongest inhibitory effect on furin and  NSPs  Our results reveal that vitamin B12 is an efficient nutraceutical for  almost all the COVID 19 drug targets. Methylcobalamin unveiled high  binding affinity with furin   9.2 kcal mol   RdRP   8.0 kcal mol    NSP5   7.3 kcal mol  NSP3   6.9 kcal mol   ORF7a   6.1 kcal mol    ORF3b   6.9 kcal mol  proteins. However  the spike protein of SARS   CoV 2 defended and demonstrated zero binding affinity with this  vitamin. In this study  Vitamin B12 exemplifies fair interaction with  furin in terms of seven H bonds and nine hydrophobic interactions. The  interacting residues of furin in context to H bonds and hydrophobic  contact are Glu 256  3.11     Gly 255  2.90     Ser 253  3.13     Ser 368   3.20     Thr 365 3.0     Arg 193  3.21     Asp 191 2.80    and Trp  254  Leu 227  Gly 229  Asp 154  Asn 190  His 364  His 194  Asn 295  Asp  258 respectively  Fig. 1 . Vitamin B12 also shows good hydrophobic  interactions with 15 amino acids  leu 172  Phe 169  Asp 170  Arg 173   Arg 249  Thr 319  Tyr 265  Phe 321  Pro 323  Arg 349  Phe 396  Thr 394   Leu 460  Pro 667  Pro 461  and four H bonds Tyr 465  3.19   . Asn 459   3.15     Cys 395  2.95     Arg 415  2.80    with RNA dependent RNA  polymerase enzyme. Fig. 2 shows that vitamin B12 has decent in  teractions with all viral targets. Vitamin B12  cobalamin  is a water   soluble vitamin produced in nature by microorganisms mainly from  animal proteins and deficiency caused with different disease states. It is  involved in different pathways as well in haematopoiesis. B12 is an  important factor for activation of transcription factors like NF  B  Myc  and Fos and thought to potentiate anti inflammatory effects. Though  vitamin B12 has been used to improve immunity in HIV infected pa  tients  there is no evidence of direct inactivation of any virus by this  compound till the date. The insilico analysis explained that vitamin B9  also proved one of the superlative inhibitors for all viral targets.

LigPlot exposed two strong  H bonds Asn310  3.15    3.02     Asn529  3.22    2.79     Gln488   3.07    2.92    and single H bond Val263  3.03     Glu271  2.78      Tyr571  3.05    between furin and this vitamin.  Vitamin B9  Folic acid  is a type of vitamin B normally found in foods  rich in iron and dried beans and mainly helps the body to produce and  maintain new cells as well as helps in DNA repair mechanisms.  It is well known that folate intake is essential for human health  because it prevents megaloblastic anemia and neural tube birth defects  as well as cardiovascular disease  dementia  cognitive function alter  ations  osteoporosis and several types of cancer. Recent computer  simulation studies on antiviral activity of vitamin B9 have been reported   31  where the authors have suggested that B9 can inactivate the furin  endoprotease that is crucial for the SARS CoV 2 virus to enter its host  cell  30 . While another work  16  explained that vitamin B9 inactivates  protease 3CLpro  which is vital in the replication of all coronaviruses.  Amongst vitamin B1 to B6  vitamin B2  B5  and B6 manifest good  H bond networks with all viral targets  Fig. S1 S2 . Our results unveil  zero affinity of vitamin B1 and B2 and no interaction with spike protein.  In contrast to that  vitamin B3  B5  and B6 have connections with spike  protein. Vitamin B5 shows a maximum of 8 H bonds with S protein and  7 H bonds with furin.  The structure of the vitamin B15 also known as pangamic acid  complexed with ORF7a  NSP5 and NSP12 highlighted hydrogen bond  interaction to be the main contributor in protein  ligand interaction  whereas binding energy contributes moderately  Fig. 4.  in this study.  This vitamin shows maximum 10 H bond interaction with ORF7a pro  tein and 7 with NSP5. It is reported that assorted strong weak H bond  unions decrease ligand binding affinity and sometimes connect poorly  with experimental binding affinity  32 . The robust hydrogen bonding  and hydrophobic interaction between vitamins with the enzyme infer it  may be a potent ORF7a and NSP5 inhibitor. Laboratory experiments  have proven the protective effect of B15 on coronary artery occlusion  and myocarditis in animals. Though controversy exists in categorising  B15 under vitamin group it has received the most attention for its effect  in stress and on athletic and physical effort. Apart from its protective  role in hypoxia  another important function of cellular detoxification  associated with cytochrome p450  B15 has a protective role in various  health conditions like fatty infiltration of liver  atherosclerosis  alcoholism etc  33 . Anticipating its role in covid 19 induced hypoxia  the present investigation also focused on its antiviral activity.  3.1.2. Vitamin D3 exhibited a good inhibitory effect on spike protein and  furin  The current study was able to discover a mechanism through binding  vitamin D3 to several proteins of SARS CoV 2. The spike glycoprotein is  necessary for viral attachment  fusion  and entrance into the host cell.  The S glycoprotein  s surface position makes it a direct therapeutic  target. Mature S glycoprotein on the viral surface is a highly glycosy   lated trimer with 1260 amino acids  residues 14 1273  in each proto   mer. S1 is made up of 672 amino acids  residues 14 685  and is divided  into four domains  an N terminal domain  NTD   a C terminal domain   CTD  also known as the receptor binding domain  RBD   and two sub  domains  SD1 and SD2 . Vitamin D3 demonstrated good binding affinity    7.4 kcal mol  with S glycoprotein. On the S1 subunit  the interacting  residues of spike with vitamin D3 are Ile 128  Ile 119  Phe 168  Tyr 170   Val 227  Leu 229  Leu 226  Phe 194  Val 126  Ile 203  and Phe 192   Fig. 5a . The vitamin D3 also displays finest dock score with proprotein  convertase 3 furin   8.2 kcal mol . At the S1 S2 cleavage site  cellular  furin or furin like proteases cut the SARS CoV 2 S glycoprotein  which  contains numerous arginine residues not present in the closely related  SARS CoV. Cleavage at the S1 S2 site produces a surface component S1   which connects the virus to the host cell surface receptor  and a trans   membrane subunit S2  which facilitates viral host cell membrane fusion.  Furin like cleavage is necessary for effective SARS CoV 2 infection of  human lung cells and is required for S protein mediated cell cell fusion  and viral infectivity. According to recent findings  vitamin D3 has an  inhibitory effect on viral entrance in the host cell because it inhibits both  viral targets. In this study  we also observed that all viral targets have  decent hydrophobic interactions with vitamins. Klebe in 2015 reported  that binding affinity of several ligands is very high due to hydrophobic  interactions. In hydrophobic interactions  ligand suppresses the lipo  philic surface of target protein and dislocates the water. Vitamin D  absorbed from diet and dietary supplements is converted to its biologi   cally active form inside the human body. Photo mediated conversion of  7  dehydrocholesterol in the skin is the primary source of Vitamin D  inside our body. Thus exposure to sunlight is important to promote  vitamin D production in the skin. Major sources of Vitamin D include egg  Fig. 1.Interaction profile for vitamin B12 in docked complex with furin  PDB Id  5JXG .  M.

To become bio  logically active D3  25 hydroxylation of vitamin D is required in the liver  and subsequent 1 hydroxylation in the kidney  34 . The fat soluble  Vitamin D plays a central role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis  that is essential for the proper development and maintenance of bone. It  is also involved in cell proliferation  differentiation  and immunomo   dulation. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of viral  infections such as influenza  respiratory tract infections  and human  immunodeficiency virus  HIV  along with many pathological condi   tions  including cancer  autoimmune diseases  cardiovascular disease   and diabetes  35  reported the reason for antiviral activity of vitamin D3  in HCV to be the increased expression of interferon  36 . In the context  of increasing respiratory tract infection cases of COVID 19 patients a  host of authors are suggesting vitamin D to be the wonder drug for cure.  However  a proper mechanism to confirm the role of vitamin D is  lacking.  3.1.3. Vitamin C interacts well with RdRp and furin  The best docking energy is as predicted by AutoDock Vina of vitamin  C with furin and RdRp proteins are  5.6 and  5.2 kcal mol subse   quently. The residues interacting with furin in context to hydrophobic  interactions are Trp 390  Thr 389  Arg391  Gln 447and in six H bonds  interactions are Leu 285  3.07     Gly284  2.88    3.19     Val 278 3.05      Ser279  2.92    3.16   . The interacting residues of RdRp with  vitamin C in hydrophobic interactions and H bond interactions are Ser  814  Asp 618  Gly 616  Phe 812  Glu 811 and Asp 761  2.86    Trp 800   3.07     Cys 813  2.98     Trp 617  2.81    2.98   . Vitamin C  ascorbic  acid  is essentially required as a natural antioxidant in the body for the  correct functioning of the immune system  it s a great immunity booster  compared to all vitamins found in nature due to its antioxidative prop  erty. Thus  it shows potentiality against various infections  including  coronavirus infections  37 . Its role in stress response after administra   tion in critically ill COVID 19 patients is well documented. To under   stand the mechanism of vitamin C  structural and non structural  SARS CoV 2 proteins were analysed. The ligand interaction maps of the  compound with best dock conformation reported in Supplementary  Fig. S3. This computational study ascertains the inhibitory effect of  ascorbic acid on all viral proteins. Viral infections generate oxidative  stress and certain redox active substances such as antiviral drugs are  expected to suppress oxidative stress and improve inflammatory symp   toms. Influential scavenging and antioxidative properties of ascorbic acid have shown protective effects. Both in vitro and in vivo clinical  trials with vitamin C treatments showed significant reduction of viral  replication without any insight to proper inhibitory mechanisms. The  present investigation may be for the first time able to find a plausible  mechanism from the observed binding properties to the viral proteins.  3.1.4. Vitamin K  E and vitamin A exhibited moderate inhibitory effect on  drug targets  Fat soluble vitamin K primarily affects blood clotting along with  wound healing as well as modulates the calcium binding in bones.  Vitamin K deficiency reported a poor outcome of COVID 19  38 . The  ligand interaction plot  Supplementary Fig. S4.  displays more hydro   phobic interactions with both vitamin K1 and K2. Vitamin K1 shows a  good docking score with one target ORF7a   7.2 kcal mol  and the  residues in context to hydrophobic interaction are Leu 16  Tyr 60  Gln 6   Tyr 5  His 4  Tyr 3  Glu 18  Leu 2  Pro 19  Lys 17. Vitamin K2 displays   7.1 kcal mol affinity with NSP3 and furin. The interacting residues of  NSP3 with vitamin K2 are Lys 55  Val 24  Ala 154  Ala 38  Val 49  Gly  130  Ala 129  Gly 48  Leu 126  Asp157  Phe156  Asp 22  Ala 52.

Vitamin E  deficiency has shown increased levels of the viral  coxsackievirus B3   infection end up with a myocardial injury in mice  due to oxidative  stress. Likewise  vitamin E deficiency in calves was associated with a  high risk of bovine coronavirus infection. Alpha tocopherol shows fair  scores  7.5 and  6.6 kcal mol with furin and NSP3 one to one. Vitamin  A plays a key role in normal eye vision  functional immune system  and  reproduction. Furthermore  it regulates the antigen presenting cells and  maintains the balance between Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes  and produces  an antibody response against an antigen  39 . Hence  it is the most  promising vitamin against lung damage due to COVID 19. Table S2 lists  the interaction amino acids of SARS CoV 2 drug targets with all  vitamins.  The ingenious element of our study is that we are disseminating the  full interaction analysis of all vitamins with all SARS CoV 2 drug targets  for the first time. This investigation provided a meticulous examination  of vitamins with one to one drug targets. As all of the vitamins were  docked one by one with the SARS CoV 2 drug targets  it was determined  that vitamin B12 maintained fair interactions with the majority of them   including Furin  RdRp  Mpro  and ORF3a. Vitamin D3 interacted well  enough with structural protein spike. We propose that vitamin B12 has a  Fig. 5.Interaction profile for  a  vitamin D3 in docked complex with spike glycoprotein of SARS CoV 2  b  furin.  M. Pandya et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100951 9considerable inhibitory effect on furin. The pathogenicity of SARS CoV   2 is directly linked to furin mediated cleavage of the viral spike glyco   protein. The inhibitory impact of vitamin B12 on furin prevents SARS   CoV 2 spike protein cleavage and viral entrance into host cells.  3.2. Molecular dynamics simulation of furin with Vitamin B12  We propose that vitamin B12 has a strong inhibitory potential  against furin. The molecular dynamics simulation on the best docking  score complex  Furin Vitamin B12  for 100 ns measures up to examine  the dynamic performance of the protein ligand complex. The structure  experienced initial fluctuation due to the kinetic shock applied during  the MD simulation. Fig. 6 shows the graphical representation of the root  mean square deviation  RMSD  and root mean square fluctuation   RMSF  of the complex in each amino acid. The amino acid in complex  with vitamin B12 maintains equilibrium throughout the simulation.  Around 1.75  0.25   RMSD was reported for equilibration of the  protein backbone. The complex re equilibrated a few times during the  100 ns simulation. Fig. 6 illustrates the retreating of the ligand orien   tation near 15 ns and  30 ns. The magnitude of fluctuation and the  difference between the average RMSD values recommended that simu  lation produced stable trajectories. In the graphs of RMSD right Y axis  represents the ligand RMSD value.  Lig fit Prot  signifies the RMSD  values of ligand with reference to protein backbone. After the 50 ns of  simulation   Lig fit Prot  value of the furin vitamin B12 complex is in the  range of 19.5  2.5  .  The root mean square fluctuation analysis  Fig. 7  correlates with the  functional analysis and the highest fluctuation in this region. This re  ported decrease in scores of particular residues proposes their direct  participation in enhancing the overall stability of the bound protein  complex  40 . The RMSF value provides information on the dynamic  behaviour of proteins in an aqueous simulated environment and is useful  for displaying localised minute changes along protein chains. The peaks  in the diagram represent the protein districts that change the greatest  throughout the simulation. Protein tails  both N  and C terminal  are  more likely to alter than other parts of the protein. Auxiliary locations of  proteins  such as alpha helices and beta strands  are often more rigid and  inflexible than unstructured sections  and hence do not oscillate like  circular framing parts of protein. The red and blue colours represent the  alpha helical and beta strand sections  respectively. The amino acid  residues 250  300  and 350 375 showed high fluctuations. This type of  illustration in an experimental setup will be time consuming  thus  creating a method for computational microscope MD to analyze the  structural effects  41 42 . In a bar chart arrangement  the interaction  analysis illustrates four types of connections established between pro  tein and ligand in normalised form during the simulation duration. The  interaction fraction is displayed on the Y axis  showing the proportion of that specific contact  whereas various interactions between the residue  and the ligand are displayed in two or three distinct colours in a bar  column. Hydrogen bonds  hydrophobic interactions such as Pi cation   pi pi stacking  water bridges and ionic interactions made by vitamin B12  with amino acids of furin during 100 ns MD simulation are denoted in  this Fig. 8. The molecular dynamics study of the best ligand receptor  complex also exhibits the stability of the compound during the simula   tion process  which validates the virtual screening and docking results.  4.Conclusion  With the progression of SARS CoV 2 infection resulting in various  worldwide waves and the lack of any effective antiviral therapy against  its treatment  vitamins are being investigated as a potential source for  anti viral therapeutic development. The present study revealed that the  role of vitamins as immunonutrition supplements could be deployed as  potential supplements to attenuate the severity of the COVID 19 infec  tion. Our results clearly state that vitamin B12 has fair interaction with  all COVID 19 drug targets. It demonstrated strong inhibitory effect on  furin by docking analysis followed by md simulation. These upshots  imply that Vitamin B12 could be the wonder molecule to shrink the  virulence by hindering the furin mediated entry of spike to host cell.  These identified vitamins may effectively assist in SARS CoV 2 thera   peutic management to boost the immunity by inhibiting the virus  imparting relief in lung inflammation.
