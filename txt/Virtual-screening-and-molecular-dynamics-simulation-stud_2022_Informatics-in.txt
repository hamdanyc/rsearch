In 2021   some vaccines are recommended as emergency licensed vaccines to protect against the virus  and efforts are  continuously ongoing to evaluate the vaccine safety measures for licensed vaccines. Recently  there was an in  crease in the cases of a new variant of coronavirus  omicron . Envelope protein plays an important role in virus  packaging and assembly. If viral assembly is blocked  there is less chance of spreading the infection to another  cell.In the present study  the plant protease inhibitors  PPIs  were screened against the envelope protein of SARS  CoV 2. The structures were downloaded from the protein data bank. The plant protease inhibitors cystatin I   Eravatmin  squash  Kunitz  Bowman Birk  Alpha amylase inhibitors  and potato serine protease inhibitors  were screened and out of them Kunitz  alpha amylase  and squash protease inhibitors have shown maximum  binding energy. The molecular dynamics simulation was performed for docked complexes showing the lowest  binding energy by NMA  normal mode analysis  to visualize the motion and stability of complexes. These plant   based protease inhibitors are a good target to fight against the new emerging strain of coronavirus because plant  extracted compounds are natural and there is fewer side effect than synthetic compounds.    1.Introduction  In recent times  the whole world faced the threat of deadly  communicable pathogens. Around 2 million people lost their lives due to  no permanent cure for this dangerous virus  1 . Several types of research  are still going on all over the world to eliminate this disease.  SARS CoV 2  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  is a highly trans   missible human causative virus. The first outbreak of SARS CoV was  identified in bats in 2003 in Guangdong province  China  2 . Human  SARS CoV 2 was observed as a new disease in 2019 which is very severe  and quickly transmissible as compared to previous reported SARS CoV   3 . In Wuhan city of China  this virus was first identified in the respi  ratory tract of a pneumonia patient. The newly identified   coronavirus   n CoV  was reported  n CoV  in December 2019  4 5 . It is a  single stranded  ss RNA  virus. It has four main structural proteins   Spike glycoprotein  small envelope glycoprotein  Membrane glycopro   tein  nucleocapsid protein  and many accessory proteins. The entry of  SARS CoV 2 in a human cell is through the attachment of Spike glyco   protein to ACE2  Angiotensin Converting Enzyme  receptor of the host  cells  6 . Firstly  it infects the ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and types II pneumocytes of the host cell  7 . The Pfizer BioNTech Comirnaty  vaccine was listed for WHO Emergency Use Listing  EUL  on 31  December 2020. Vaccine safety and its efficacy against infection is  ongoing and checked by WHO experts in collaboration with the research  institute  8 . Globally  there were 402 044 502 confirmed cases of  COVID 19 and 5 770 023 deaths were reported in the last week across  the world  9 . As of 6th February 2022  a total of 10 095 615 243 vac  cine doses have been administered  10 . On 26 November 2021  WHO  designated the variant B.1.1.529 a variant of concern  named Omicron   on the advice of WHO  s Technical Advisory Group on Virus Evolution   TAG VE . The TAG VE that Omicron has several mutations that it is not  yet clear how it spread or how it is severe  11 . The Omicron variant is  the most heavily mutated variant which paves the way for enhanced  transmissibility and partial resistance to immunity induced by  COVID 19 vaccines  12 . Omicron will not be the last variant and the  next variant of concern is likely to be more transmissible and there will  be more immune escape making existing vaccines less effective against  new variants  13 .  The plant contains various compounds which act in its defense  mechanism against various pests. Plants are a good source for drug   Corresponding author.

Plant extraction is the field of  investigation which acts as herbal medicines to cure human disease from  a long time ago. There are many plant based drugs like quinine  anti  malarial drug   taxol  anticancer drug   and reserpine  antihypertensive  drug  were extracted from different plants  14 15 . Plant protease in  hibitors have targeted some proteases and shown antiviral activities   16 19 . The envelope protein of SARS CoV 2 is the most mysterious  and smallest protein of 8.4 12 kDa among all the structural proteins. It is  integral membrane protein and consists of 76 109 amino acids  20 21 .  It undergoes a post translational modification. It generates a viroporin   ion channel protein  by homotypic interaction  22 23 . The SARS CoV E protein has recently been found to contain a binding motif known as  the postsynaptic density protein 95  PSD95  Drosophila disc large  tumour suppressor  Dlg1  zonula occludens 1 protein  zo 1    PDZ  binding motif  PBM   located in the last four amino acids of the C  terminus  24 . The PDZ domain is a protein protein interaction module  that can bind to the C terminus of target proteins such as the cellular  adapter proteins involved in host cell processes important for viral  infection  25 27 . The PBM based attenuated and live vaccine would be  designed or also enough to abolish and non functional the pathogenicity  of the virus. The Co expression of M and E proteins led to the formation  of virus like particles  VLP   but not an expression of M protein alone   28 29 . It is abundantly expressed inside the infected cell during  replication of the cell cycle but a small portion is incorporated into the  virion envelope  30 . Envelope protein has played main three roles  in  viral assembly  the release of virions  and pathogenesis of virus  31 33 .  Presently  Bowanman Brik Inhibitors  Oryza cystatin  Alpha amylase   squash  Kunitz  vitamin and Potato Serine Protease Inhibitors were  selected according to their inhibitory activity reported against different  proteins. The present study aimed to estimate the inhibitory interaction  of coronavirus E  Envelope  protein with various types of plant proteases  inhibitors by use of bioinformatics tools.  2.Materials and methods  2.1.

Active site and molecular docking for protein interaction analysis  Six active sites were predicted for interaction with other molecules  by CASTp. The active site regions of envelope protein were shown in  Fig. 3. These active sites were used for binding with ligands which are  different from each in their size  area  and volume shown in  Table 1 .  The active pocket site 1 is the specific binding site of all the ligands  24   Leu   45  Val   52  Tyr.  The envelope protein was docked with all selected protease in  hibitors. The reference ligands as shown in Fig. 2 were docked into the  pocket site of the envelope protein  the binding affinity of the protein  with ligand was calculated and shown in Table 2. Proteins with the  higher binding affinity were shown in Fig. 4. The criteria of selection  were based on its global energy score  lower the global energy higher the  binding affinity between protein and ligands. From all proteases alpha   amylase inhibitor wrightideR1  Fig. 4a  is showing global energy  2.82  k mol   kunitz  sti  type inhibitor  Fig. 4b  is with global energy    33.67 k mol   and Squash  Fig. 4c  showing the global energy  0.04  k mol . From these three  kunitz was the best target inhibitor protease to  fight against coronavirus envelope protein because of the highest  binding affinity for envelope protein of coronavirus.  3.2. Molecular dynamics simulation of docked receptor ligand complexes  The 3 D interaction of receptor and ligand complexes of squash   kunitz and alpha amylase proteases inhibitors with envelope protein of  coronavirus were shown in Fig. 5  a  b  c . The arrow indicates the di  rection of motion of amino acids residues. Fig. 5  d  e  f  represents the  deformability graph which showed that the higher deformability is  present at mainly hinge regions that is flexible.

Recently  the virus spread worldwide and causing numerous deaths.  There is no specific drug available for the disease but some vaccines are  available to activate immunity against virus for future infection. It be  comes a controversial that these vaccines are effective for new strain of  virus. There is no surety of vaccines that is completely effective against  coronavirus so we focused on some natural proteases inhibitors which  can be helpful to control the spreading of Coronavirus. The study is  based on specific targeting of SARS CoV E protein to find novel com  pounds that can be used as a new agent against Coronavirus. Plant ex  tracts are a good source to fight against HIV  Hepatitis C virus  and also  for MARS CoV  36 38 . Two proteinase inhibitors were purified from  C. annuum leaves  i.e.  CapA1 and CapA2  with in vitro and in vivo  inhibitory activity for Helicoverpa armigera proteinases. Trypsin in  hibitors from Capsicum baccatum var. pendulum leaves show inhibitory  activity against Pepper yellow mosaic virus  39 . The Plant Proteases  inhibitors  PPIs  are small proteins that are accumulated in storage tissues e.g. seeds and tubers and also found in plant aerial parts  40 .  The protease inhibitors have been found in legumes and cereals  41 43 .  The widespread distribution of protease inhibitors throughout the plant  kingdom is well known since 1938  44 . The plant contains various  kinds of proteases inhibitors belonging to the family such as Kunitz   Bowman Birk  PotatoI  Potato II  serpine  squash  rapeseed  mustard   cereal  45 46 . These inhibitors have been used as therapeutic agents   47 49 . Ervatamin C  a cysteine protease was isolated from the Erva  tamia coronaria was a potent inhibitor of Ervatamin. It can hydrolyze   BAPA  benzoylarginine p nitroanilide  a potent substrate of papain and  very highly specific activity cleaves denatured natural proteins  50 .  From Delonix Regia seeds  DrTI   a Kunitz  STI  inhibitor was isolated  and it is an effective inhibitor of HPK  Human Plasma Kallikrein  and  trypsin  51 . Alpha amylase inhibitors are Wr AI1 and Wr  AI2 isolated  from W. religiosa and both of them have antibacterial and hemolytic  activity and inhibition against TMA  Tenebrio Molitor   amylase   52 .  Bowan  Brik Inhibitors are isolated from barley seeds that inhibit two  trypsin molecules  53 . Oryza cystatin has potent inhibitory activity  against papain and cysteine proteases and is isolated from Oryza sativa L.  Japonica  54 . Potato tuber  s protein inhibits the serine protease  55 .  These plant proteases inhibitors inhibit the target protein and may be  useful for natural drugs formation.  New Kunitz TI from seeds of B. variegata var. Variegate Bauhinia  trypsin inhibitor with the abilities to induce the production of multiple  cytokines and selectively inhibit the proliferation of nasopharyngeal  carcinoma CNE 1 cells  56 . We perform molecular docking of the seven  PPIs  Bowan Brik Inhibitors  oryzacystatin  alpha amylase  squash   kunitz  ervatamin and potato serine protease inhibitors  which already  have potential efficacy against TMA  Tobacco Mosaic Virus   HIV virus   57 . Envelope protein of virus has main role in assembly  packaging  and pathogenesis. The protein is also a role in the formation of VLP   Virus Like Particle  by co associated with the M protein. Targeting the  envelope protein of coronavirus is efficient to stop viral assembly and  pathogenesis of the virus. Among seven PPIs only 3  alpha amylase   squash  kunitz  have the lowest docked binding energy with the target.  The alpha amylase  squash  and kunitz have binding energy 2.82  0.04    33.67. The kunitz was having the lowest binding energy in comparison  to squash and alpha amylase inhibitors. We have also done molecular  dynamics simulation of these three docked complexes to check the sta  bility and motion of the structure. The eigen value for squash  kunitz   and alpha amylase complexed with E protein is 4.549e 05  8.836e 05   7.540e 05 indicating the greater stability of complexes. The results  reveal that the complex structure is stable and can be used as a drug  against coronavirus. Our study may be helpful to the formation of a new  drug against coronavirus.  5.Conclusion  From the current effort  we have screened PPIs  Plant Protease in  hibitors  against SARS CoV envelope protein by molecular docking and  molecular dynamic simulation. Among these screened plant proteases  inhibitors kunitz inhibitor  alpha amylase inhibitors and squash in  hibitors have showed good binding energy. These inhibitors are the fine  target for drug development against coronavirus strain. The binding  energy of kunitz inhibitor was the best among these three inhibitors.  Kunitz inhibitors are the superior protease inhibitors to fight against  new strain of coronavirus.
