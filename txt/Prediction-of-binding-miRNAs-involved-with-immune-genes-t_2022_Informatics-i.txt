This biological process could lead to virus repression  serve as biomarkers for diagnosis  or as potential treat  ments for this disease. One source of concern is attempting to uncover the viral regions in which this binding  could occur  as well as how these miRNAs binding could affect the SARS COV 2 virus  s processes. Using extracted  sequence features from this base pairing  we predicted the relationships between miRNAs that interact with  genes involved in immune function and bind to the SARS COV 2 genome in their 5 UTR region. We compared  two supervised models  SVM and Random Forest  with an unsupervised One Class SVM. When the results of the  confusion matrices were inspected  the results of the supervised models were misleading  resulting in a Type II  error. However  with the latter model  we achieved an average accuracy of 92   sensitivity of 96.18   and  specificity of 78 . We hypothesize that studying the bind of miRNAs that affect immunological genes and bind to  the SARS COV 2 virus will lead to potential genetic therapies for fighting the disease or understanding how the  immune system is affected when this type of viral infection occurs.    1.Introduction  Micro RNAs  miRNAs  are non coding RNAs that bind to messenger  RNA  mRNA  or specific genes  suppressing or even blocking their  expression by up or down regulating their functions. Certain studies  have found that miRNAs bind to human mRNA and that they can also  attach to external or endogenous RNA  as in the case of viruses. MiRNAs  may bind to viral RNA because they cannot distinguish it from host  mRNA  according to Nersisyan et al.  1 . In this case  miRNAs could bind  to the mRNA of a viral genome  repressing transcription or even pre  venting the virus from reproducing. For example  Wong et al.  2   discovered that the action of hosts   miRNAs influenced Dengue Virus  replication. This procedure occurred when a direct binding to the  genome of this viral form happened.  The one class Support Vector Machine  SVM  model was developed  by Sch olkopf et al.  3   and it is based on the theory of hyperplane  separation between classes  as is the two class SVM model. The difficulty  in using a two class model is that on some occasions  samplings from one  class are scarce  or we only have samples from one type  this is when  models like One class SVM appear adequate. Another issue is that it is  difficult to obtain samples from the negative  positive  class  4 5 . In relation to miRNA targeting and binding to specific genes  we  recognize that  while this process is more likely to occur in the 3 UTR  region  there is some intriguing evidence that it could also occur in the 5  UTR region. For example  in the work of Zhou and Rigoutsus  6   the  authors stated that they found two target sites of the miR 103a 3p with  the GPRC5A  a tumor suppressor gene  in epithelial and pancreatic  cancer cells  and that this bind occurred in the 5 UTR region. Interest   ingly  these interactions occurred in both the less conserved and  conserved regions of the 5 UTR  additionally  Lee et al.  7  discovered  that some miRNAs that bind to the 5 UTR part also contain 5 end  interaction sections that they attach to the 3 UTRs. Lee et al.  7  also  mentioned the presence of endogenous motifs in human 5 UTRs that  bind to the 3 ends of miRNAs.  The particular findings of the review article by Ying et al.  8   demonstrated that miRNA binding occurs not only in the 3 UTR region  but also in the 5 UTR region. Other authors  such as Bruscella et al.  9    support the hypothesis that host miRNAs have an affinity to bind to the  viral 5 UTR region of viruses. This region binding is important because it  may play a role in the viral replication of diseases like dengue  2 .  Furthermore  Baldassarre et al.  10  cited several studies that demon   strate the importance of the 5 UTR in coronavirus replication and   Corresponding author.

When considering the SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 sequences   the authors also mentioned conserved regions obtained through  sequence alignment  noting that focusing on these areas could help  inhibit virus replication  10 . Moreover  some authors  such as  Mukhopadhyay et al.  11   demonstrate that this untranslated region  contains many conserved regions of about 90 nucleotides.  In the present research  our goal was to gather a subset of miRNAs  involved in the expression of genes present in the immune system.  Furthermore  we wanted to predict the probable binding with the SARS   COV 2 RNA. For this task  we compared two supervised models  SVM  and Random Forest  with a One class SVM to predict the binding of  miRNAs to immune genes while considering the SARS CoV 2 5 UTR  region. We focused on sequence characteristics based on k mers and  thermodynamic features such as the Minimum Free Energy  MFE  of the  RNA  s secondary structure when developing our Machine Learning  models. These features were found in the binding of miRNA immune  genes to viral RNA. Because animal miRNA binding does not always  exhibit perfect Watson Crick complementarity  as it does in plants  12   relying solely on sequence alignment between miRNA and genes or the  viral strand would be insufficient. Previous studies using this approach  include the work of Guti errez C  ardenas and Wang  13 14   who used  sequence based features to identify non coding RNAs with genes  involved in breast cancer scenarios.  We divided our work into the following sections  Section 2 will  define the One Class SVM model as well as some useful bioinformatics  concepts. The methodology and experiments with a set of miRNAs  the  SARS COV 2 genome sequence  and immune genes will be described in  Section 3. This section will focus on the extracted features and the tuning  of our Machine Learning models. Section 4 will present our findings  from comparing our two class supervised models to our One class SVM  model. Following this section  we will discuss our findings based on a  review of the current literature and some conclusions drawn from the  current work.  2.Background  2.1. Bioinformatics concepts  2.1.1. Sequence alignment  When comparing two different DNA or RNA strands  one method for  determining similarities is to compare their nucleotide information  using a scoring function. It is similar to compare two strings made up of  the letters A  C  T  G  and U  each of which corresponds to a different  nucleotide. The Needleman Wunsch algorithm  15  is one method for  obtaining this score. When a match occurs  this algorithm returns a  positive score. When a gap in a position occurs  a negative score is  assigned. These two strands can be used as the indexes of an array in the  computational implementation  and the score can be obtained using  dynamic programming  see Fig. 1 .  2.1.2. Minimum Free Energy and binding  The RNA molecules present different forms or organizations of their  material  one way to visualize an RNA strand is to consider it as a  sequence of nucleotides with a 5 and a 3 ends in the following way   5 AAUUGCGGGAAA   UUCA3  This initial conformation shown above is known as their primary  structure. However  RNA can also form secondary and tertiary structures  in which the formation of loops  known as hairpin loops  is fairly com  mon  see Fig. 2 .  In Fig. 2a  for example  a hairpin loop can be seen forming in the  lower part of the RNA molecule. Also. We can observe some comple   mentary sequences that have their nucleotides aligned in the middle.  Prediction of secondary and tertiary structures is one task that bio  informaticians face  16 . For example  in secondary structures  one  could predict it using the thermodynamics principle. These thermody   namic principles are simple. The theory is that when a molecule is more stable  it tends to has more energy  accordingly to the concept of Min  imum Free Energy  MFE . In Fig. 3  we can see an RNA secondary  structure with matches and mismatches. The MFE is calculated based on  the energy present in adjacent nucleotides  with lower energy present in  those nucleotides close to each other. When the total summation is  calculated  a more negative value indicates that the molecule is more  stable  16 .  2.1.3. K mers  A k mer is just a subset or a substring obtained from a larger genetic  molecule but with a fixed size. It is usually formed by using a sliding  window of n characters  for example  if we have the following DNA  string   AAACCTGGACCTT  And if we want to form a 2 mer  we could join each par of nucleotides  and advance the string to the right by a sliding window of two characters  giving us   AA  AA  AC  CC  CT.  The use of k mers has different applications in bioinformatics  such  as the reconstruction of genetic material given their partial sequences  and finding shared k mers between sequences that could serve to find  gene similarities.  2.2. Unsupervised models  One class SVM  Sch olkopf et al.  3  proposed the One Class SVM  a model for novelty  detection based on a SVM classifier with only one training class. This  model generates a mapping by using kernels to separate the data from  the origin by a maximum margin  3 . If the data is contained within a  region  it returns a value of  1  otherwise  it returns a value of  1. In  addition  unlike traditional SVM models  which require at least two  categories  this model allows for outlier detection using only one class. It  is important to note that the data in a One class SVM is not labeled. Still   a subset of the data could be extracted and labeled as positive or nega  tive for the application of metrics to measure the quality of our model.  The notion of kernels as in SVM is also applied to One class SVM to  transform a set of data points to another dimension using the kernel  function. The decision boundary in this model is based on   WB  X  b 0  1   In Eq.  1     X   corresponds to the transformation of X into a higher   Fig. 1.Global alignment between a pair of sequences.  J.

We need to formulate this as  an optimization problem in which the value of WB  X  b is positive for  holding as many of the samples that belong to the N training set  this is  because we believe that most of the samples will be enclosed in the  positive class. Therefore  if we have the contrary case in which WB  X   b is negative  we can have a slack penalty of max b WB  X C0 . In this  case  we are rewarding that the origin is farther away from the sepa  rating hyperplane. If we account that we also need a regularize term  1 2  W  2  we will end up with the following objective function  see Eq.  2    MinJ 1 2  W  2 C N N i 1max b WB  X C0  b  2   Furthermore  the C value acts like a regularization factor that deals  with the misclassification of the samples considering a trade off between the false positives and false negatives obtained from the model  17 .  3.Materials and methods  3.1. Methodology  The goal of this study was to predict the possible binding of miRNAs  to the SARS COV 2 virus and the 5 UTR region. For this purpose  we put  together a list of miRNAs with information pertaining primarily to their  ID and genomic sequence. The miRNAs from this list were paired with  the viral 5 UTR region.  In addition  we obtained a list of genes involved in the immunology  processes of the human body. Following that  we generated a new list of  miRNAs that are known to bind to these genes. This obtained list served  as our positive class  while those unrelated  or lacking a match in the  dataset generated  served as our negative class. We hypothesize that  when there is a viral infection  miRNAs are likely to bind to these im  mune genes  and therefore it would be relevant to predict if there is an  affinity for binding to the SARS COV 2 gene as well. To test our hy  pothesis  we used an SVM and a Random Forest  RF  as supervised  models  and a One class model SVM. Fig. 4 depicts a diagram of our  methodology.  Concerning the datasets that we used  we extracted the SARS COV 2  Genome in FASTA format  which is available in NCBI under the acces   sion number GenBank  MN908947.3. To develop our proof of concept   we only worked with the binding in the 5 UTR region of this genome  sequence. In the introduction to this paper  we provided a justification  for our decision.  Nucleotide 1 to nucleotide 265 are included in the FASTA sequence  for the 5 UTR region. In terms of miRNA use  we obtained a list of  miRNAs from miRBase  18   focusing only on those that correspond to  human species. In addition  we obtained a list of genes involved in our  organism  s immune process by accessing the InnateDB list at https     www.innatedb.com  . This dataset contains information from 4723  immune related genes  see Table 1 .  3.2. Features extracted  We extracted the frequency of 3 mers from the set of miRNA se  quences. Zhang et al.  19  also developed this method for extracting  features from k mer data. This number of 3 mers was selected as the  Fig. 2. a  Secondary structure and  b  Tertiary structure of an RNA molecule  generated with RNAFold Web Server and with RNA Composer respectively .

Furthermore  other authors  such as  Wen et al.  21   demonstrated that higher values  such as 4 mers or  5 mers  produced results with negligible between both types of k mers.  In addition  we used a dataset that contained miRNAs associated with  various genes involved in immunological processes  see Table 2 .  We obtained the MFE generated by a match between the miRNA  sequence and this genomic region using the genomic sequence of the  5 UTR from the SARS COV 2 virus. We used the Vienna package  22   and their RNAduplex function to calculate the hybridization of two se  quences and to obtain potential bindings between mRNA and RNA  22 .  Additionally  we performed a pairwise sequence alignment of the 5 UTR  and the miRNA sequence. To accomplish this procedure  we first had to  transcribe the miRNA sequence and then complement it  because we  wanted to obtain a score based on nucleotide matching or using the  canonical Watson Crick base pairing  see Table 3 . This table would be  used as an input for the different machine learning models that were  tested.  3.3. Application of supervised models  SVM and RF  In this section of our research  we wanted to see if there could be an  interaction between those miRNAs that have an affinity for binding to  genes involved in immunological processes. As a result  we extracted  two classes from our entire dataset. The positive class corresponded to  those miRNAs that bind to these immune genes  while the negative class corresponded to those that did not have a validated interaction with  these genes. For both supervised methods  we used the GridSearch  method with ten fold cross validation and a weighted scoring schema to  tune their hyperparameters. We validated our results by testing the ac  curacy  sensitivity and specificity of our models with these values.  3.4. One class SVM comparison with supervised models  With our one class model  we needed to select the best hyper   parameters for this model  s application. We used a Grid Search CV with  five folds for this purpose. To validate our results  we ran our model ten  times  similar to a cross validation procedure  and selected different  random samples from the negative class  then  we used a set of metrics to  assess its performance. It is worth noting that we used a subset of  negative samples made up of miRNAs that bind to the mRNA virus but  do not have a matching relationship with genes involved in immune  processes when compared to the list provided by the Innate DB.  The previous description can be briefly be summarized in the  following pseudocode   Algorithm 1.Comparison of classifier for binding predictions between  miRNAs and immune genes     Fig. 4.Schemata of the methodology followed.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100958 54.Results  4.1. Supervised models and misleading results  SVM and RF  4.1.1. SVM  We divided our entire subset into two classes for this section and then  used a GridSearch with a weighted score to determine the best param   eters to use with this supervised model. Using the data from the  InnateDB database  we created a list of 818 miRNAs that interact with  genes involved in immunological processes  and other 1730 miRNAs that act as their counterparts. Our SVM model was initially tested with  both complete subsets  but the results were inconclusive. With no  defined values for sensitivity and specificity  we obtained an accuracy of  67.84  with the entire dataset. The true positive value was zero  and  the false negative value was also zero.  With a ten fold Grid Search cross validation we tried the following  parameters  kernel values  RBF and polynomial  penalization value  C   as a list with values ranging from 10 2 to 102  degrees for the poly  nomial kernel ranging from 2 to 5  gamma as a list with values ranging  from 10 6 to 30. The parameters selected were kernel  rbf  C  0.01   J. Guti errez C  ardenas and Z. Wang                                                                                                                                                                                                         

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100958 6and gamma  10 5. With these parameters  we found using 10 fold  cross validation a training accuracy of 82.54   a standard deviation  of 0.0008  and test accuracy of 82.54   with a standard deviation of  0.003. Despite the fact that these results appeared promising  we  discovered a miss classification for the true negative class  a type II  error. The significance of this type of error analysis stems from the  fact that it could classify a miRNA with their respective connection with  an immune gene because it would not bind the SARS COV 2 viral  sequence  however  this binding may exist in reality. We validated these  results by generating a ROC curve from our data. The results from the  ROC curve can be observed in Fig. 5  and the confusion matrix can be  seen in Table 4a  indicating that there is a problem classifying the  negative samples.  According to the SVM model results our classifier was having diffi  culty discriminating samples from the negative category. These samples  corresponded to miRNAs that were known to bind to viral mRNA  but they did not have validated interactions with genes involved in immu   nological processes.  4.1.2. Random Forest  We proceeded to select the best hyperparameters that could be  suitable for our model after dividing our data into positive and negative  samples  as the SVM model previously mentioned. We used the Grid  Search algorithm with the following parameters  number of estimators  with values ranging from 10 to 300  with a 50 point interval between  numbers  number of maximum features was tested using the square root  of these values and the log of 2 number of features. In terms of maximum  depth  the tested values ranged from 4 to 16 on four by four value in  tervals  finally  the tested splitting criteria were Gini and Entropy. We  discovered that the best hyperparameters were  splitting criteria  en  tropy  maximum depth of the trees  12  number of maximum features   square root  and number of trees or estimators  10. We obtained an  accuracy of approximately 82.88  in the test set with these hyper   parameters  promising similar results as before  however  we discovered  a type II error with no values for the true negative class again  see  Table 4b. Therefore  w e decided to use a One class model to see how it  behaves with our data based on these results  which typically occur in  imbalanced scenarios.  4.2. Unsupervised One class SVM comparison with supervised models  We started by using a Grid Search algorithm to select the best  hyperparameters. Considering this technique  we discovered that the  best hyperparameters for this technique were kernel  rbf  nu value   0.01  and gamma  0.03449. With these data  we executed our model  ten times with different subsets of samples containing 5  of the negative  class chosen without replacement  and we averaged the results of the  metrics obtained. This method of data selection is similar to using a  cross validation model. After reviewing our results  we discovered more  stable and promising values than those obtained with the supervised  models. We achieved an average accuracy of 90.90  with a standard  deviation of 0.02  sensitivity of 96.18  with a standard deviation of  0.01  and specificity of 76.39  with a standard deviation of 0.1  see  Table 5.  Table 5 shows that the specificity values for the supervised models  are not overly significant. It is important to remember that the speci   ficity in this case refers to those miRNA that do not interact with immune  genes or have a true negative value. In the case of the SVM  we can see  that this value is undetermined because there are no true negative  values  according to Table 4 a . Furthermore  the Random Forest model  has a specificity value of only 50   implying that this model has the  same precision in this metric as a random process  resulting in a limiting  prediction power for this type of problem. These drawbacks were solved  by using the one class model  which was able identify miRNAs that were  likely to interact with immune genes and bind to SARS COV 2.  5.Discussion  In this paper  we attempted to predict the binding of miRNAs that  have a relationship with immune genes and may be prone to bind to the  SARS COV 2 virus  s 5 UTR region. The significance of selecting this 5   UTR has been described in various studies  highlighting its importance  in viral replication  6 8 10 . We used a few datasets related to miRNAs  and genes involved in immune processes to determine which were  relevant to our research goals.  We downloaded a list of predicted miRNAs that could target viral  mRNA according to the study of Sa ar and Adan  23  for verification  purposes  based on the list of miRNAs that we used for our classification  models. From a list of 107 miRNAs obtained by these authors  we found  that 80 of them were present in the list of miRNAs that we extracted as  target genes involved in immunological processes  and we hypothesized  that they could bind to the SARS CoV 2 viral.

We could mention the study of Maghsoudnia et al.  24  regarding the  miRNA let 7b in relation to some of the miRNAs that have some  connection with immune genes and that we considered to be prone to  bind to the SARS COV 2. This miRNA was discovered to target specific  respiratory chain genes by this author  and it has been used in drug  targeting in apoptotic cells. The SARS CoV 2 virus has a relationship  with this respiratory chain in that ACE2 positive individuals are a target  of this virus  causing cardiac and respiratory issues  25 . Gasparello  et al.  26  discovered that hsa miR 450a 5p may bind to the IL 8 gene   which is involved in cytokine storms  and that this biomarker is one of  the predictors of patient survival when they are hospitalized. Another  example is how miRNA hsa miR 192  3p binds to NR1H4 and contrib   utes to SARS COV 2 progression  27 . According to Alshabi et al.  19    miRNA hsa miR 6809  5p binds to the S region or spike gene from the  SARS COV 2 genome  however  we discovered that it could also bind to  the 5 UTR region.  Despite the fact that the genome of the SARS COV 2 virus differs  from that of influenza cases  some miRNAs are present in them as well   which are also prone to bind to the 5 UTR region of the SARS COV 2  mRNA sequence. These interactions were discovered with the hsa   miR 6873  5p  28  and the hsa miR 4276  27 . Other types of miRNAs   such as the hsa miR 7111  5p  which binds the HOXC8 gene and up regulates it  are also found in diseases that could result in  co morbidity in SARS COV virus scenarios  29 .  Using a pair of supervised machine learning models and one unsu  pervised model  we used features extracted from the sequences of these  miRNAs to the 5 UTR region of the SARS COV 2 virus to find some  match between these miRNAs and this viral form. The use of features  extracted from sequence analysis instead of gene expression in miRNA  studies has also been mentioned in the works of Guti errez C  ardenas and  Wang  13 14 .  We discovered that the results of using two class supervised models  were a little misleading. This was due to the fact that  despite having an  acceptable level of accuracy of around 82  for both models  we  concluded that no true negative samples were correctly classified when  we validated our confusion matrices. We came to the conclusion that we  were dealing with a pseudo imbalanced class. We coined the term   pseudo imbalanced class   because  despite partitioning our data into  positive and negative categories using the golden rule of 70 30 for the  train  positive  and test  negative  classes  the models were having dif  ficulty correctly classifying the negative classes. This did not happen  when we used our One class SVM model  which produced more stable  results  as discussed in the Results section of this article.  According to Li et al.  30   among the genes studied  CADM1 pro  moted immune surveillance and was linked to COVID 19. In terms of  potential treatments  Klinger et al.  31  found that drugs targeting the  cyclin dependent kinase 6  CDK6  are important for treating patients  with this disease. M ller et al.  32  discovered that SYT4 was  down regulated after a SARS CoV 2 infection  however  while the au  thors establish a link between this gene and beta cell physiology or  diabetes  other authors  such as Jiang et al.  33   discovered a link be  tween this gene and immune cells.  One limitation of the current study is that potential pathways be  tween the discovered miRNAs and other cellular components or func  tions must be validated using genome wide association studies.  It is worth noting that  at the time of writing the present study  we  were unable to find literature on the use of One class models to study Table 3  Features extracted of the miRNAs sequences.   miRNA miRTarBase  ID Species   miRNA  Target  Gene Species   Target Gene  Experiments seqMirna alignS duplex AAUm  hsa let 7a   2 3p MIRT058253 Homo  sapiens CADM1 Homo sapiens PAR CLIP CUGUAC 16.9  13.7 0  hsa let 7a   3p MIRT038998 Homo  sapiens ARMC8 Homo sapiens CLASH CUAUAC 14.8  9.5 0.047619  hsa let 7a   5p MIRT000415 Homo  sapiens CDK6 Homo sapiens CLASH UGAGGU 16.1  15.5 0  hsa let 7b   3p MIRT038996 Homo  sapiens SYT4 Homo sapiens CLASH CUAUAC 16.5  9 0  hsa let 7b   5p MIRT001229 Homo  sapiens CDC34 Homo sapiens Luciferase reporter assay  Western blot UGAGGU 16.1  19.2 0  hsa let 7c   3p MIRT060727 Homo  sapiens RPS3 Homo sapiens PAR CLIP CUGUAC 16.9  9.4 0  hsa let 7c   5p MIRT000408 Homo  sapiens CDC25A Homo sapiens Immunohistochemistry  Luciferase reporter  assay  qRT PCR  Western blot UGAGGU 16.1  16.8 0  hsa let 7d   3p MIRT038993 Homo  sapiens CAPN15 Homo sapiens CLASH CUAUAC 16.5  11.7 0  hsa let 7d   5p MIRT002005 Homo  sapiens HMGA2 Homo sapiens Luciferase reporter assay AGAGGU 16.1  16.8 0   Fig. 5.ROC curve obtained from the SVM model.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100958 8interactions between miRNAs  immune genes  and the SARS COV 2.  Furthermore  we believe that studying miRNAs that bind to these viral  strands and are involved in immune system regulation could fill a  research gap in our efforts to understand how our immune system re  sponds in the presence of this viral infection.  6.Conclusions  The interaction between host miRNAs and SARS COV 2 mRNA could  lead to a potential field of research in order to find new therapeutics to  alleviate the current pandemic situation. We were able to identify a  subset of human miRNAs that are likely to bind to the 5 UTR region of  the SARS COV 2 mRNA genome by applying a One class SVM model to a  set of human miRNAs. The validated literature results also showed that  the miRNAs discovered were linked to other types of diseases  such as  obesity  lung damage  and others. Furthermore  we found promising  results in the study of miRNAs associated with genes involved in the  body  s immune response. Because these miRNAs are present in the  human body  s immunological response and serve to counter attack this  type of viral infection  they may bind to the SARS COV 2 viral mRNA   paving the way for future research in this field. Future research will look  into other regions where miRNA binding could occur  such as the 3 UTR  or the role of the seed site in this process.
