Alzheimer  s disease  AD  is a progressive neurological illness distinguished by age related  dementia  mental abnormalities  and poor memory  among other symptoms. However  Huntington  s disease   HD  is influenced by genetics as well as a generalized dysfunction of the motor system. Despite the fact that  many similar genetic elements have been found in the literature as being interrelated between these two diseases   it is still unclear how people acquire infected with these two neurological disorders. Detecting biomarkers for  Alzheimer  s and Huntington  s disease in brain tissue might help in drug development and treatment. The pur  pose of this research was to find brain cell transcripts that show levels of gene expression linked to the pro  gression of Alzheimer  s and Huntington  s disease. A bioinformatics pipeline was used to study one RNA Seq  transcriptomic dataset and one microarray dataset  and 24 significant differentially expressed genes  DEGs  were  discovered that were shared by two brain cell datasets. We uncovered disease gene association networks and  signaling pathways  as well as gene ontology  GO  investigations and hub protein identification  to determine the  roles of these DEGs. The discovery of significant gene ontologies and molecular pathways increased our un  derstanding of the pathophysiology of these two disorders  and the hub proteins B2M  HLA A  HLA E  HLA B   HLA C  HLA F  CANX  HLA DQA1  HLA DRA  and HLA DRB1 might be exploited to design therapeutic in  terventions. In neurological disorder subjects  we uncovered efficient hypothetical linkages between pathogenic  processes in brain cells  implying that brain cells may be exploited to detect and monitor illness origin and  development  as well as design pharmacological therapies.    1.Introduction  Alzheimer  s disease  AD  is a chronic neurological illness that  gradually robs patients of cognitive function and eventually leads to  death  1 . AD is a neurological condition that is growing more common  in the world  s aging populations  2 3 . Age is the most notable hazard  indicator for AD  4 . The condition is never visible in children  even  when they have disease causing mutations that cause to be over  expressed from birth  5 . Because most people  s memory degrades slightly with age  the distinction between typical age related forgetful   ness and the initial signs of AD can be blurry  2 . Its symptoms involved  memory loss  linguistic difficulties  and erratic behavior. He investi   gated that affected brain after her death and identified many abnormal  clumps  now recognized as amyloid plaques  and tangled bundles of  fibers  now called neurofibrillary  or tau  tangles . These plaques and  tangles in the brain are mostly considered to be among of Alzheimer  s  disease  s most visible features  6 . Alzheimer  s disease is estimated to  affect 2.3 million people in the United States  range  1.09  4.8 million    Corresponding author.

The prevalence of AD increases every five years after age 60  rising  from 1  for individuals between the ages of 60 and 64 to up to 40  for  those aged 85 and above  7 .  Huntington  s disease  HD  is indeed a rare hereditary neurological  disease characterized by uncontrolled excessive neurological move   ments and cognitive and emotional deficits  8 9 . Symptoms of HD often  appear in middle age after infected people have had children  although  the condition may appear at any point between infancy and senescence   10 . Huntington  s  the disease causing defective protein  has an  enlarged CAG repetition  resulting in a polyglutamine sequence at the  N terminus that may be any length. There  s evidence to support the  theory that this extra segment provides a harmful functional benefit   10 .  Huntington  s disease  HD  and Alzheimer  s disease  AD  are two  neurological illnesses that overlap clinical characteristics associated  with specific brain impairment. Both disorders are caused by misfolding  and deposition of particular proteins that associate with mitochondria  and disrupt with endoplasmic reticulum  ER  mitochondria contact  sites  11 . The accumulation of data suggests that mitochondrial Ca2  homeostasis dysfunction underpins the vulnerability to specific  neuronal death reported in HD and AD  11 . Moss  12  proposed that  transcription is interrupted in peripheral cells in HD via processes that  are similar to those seen in the brain. The convergence of immunological  upregulation in HD and AD implies a common pathogenic process  incorporating macrophage phagocytosis and microglial synaptic prun  ing  and thus opens the possibility of addressing both diseases with  similar treatment methods  12 .  Microarray based gene expression analysis is the most widely used  and successful high throughput technology for studying complex disease  etiology. Human ovarian cancer  OC  gene expression profiling studies   on the other hand  are extremely rare. In this study  we attempted to  investigate the differentially expressed genes  DEGs   gene network   pathways  and protein interactions that are specific to HD  13 . To  interpret the biological significance of these changes in gene expression   we used an integrated bioinformatic analysis that expanded on traditional microarray analysis methods  such as Gene Ontology  GO   and pathway analysis  to build interaction networks that could identify  novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets  14 . Denggang Fu   15  claims Computational biology was used to study the potential  molecular processes and tumor immune landscape of these IRGs. An  examination of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and immune checkpoint  molecules indicated a different immunological landscape in the  high risk and low risk groups. In several articles  bioinformatics ap  proaches have been applied to identify potential molecular biomarkers   pathway analysis  gene ontology  and drug targets  13 17 .  According to JiahuiWan  16  because the most well known molec   ular mechanism of lncRNA is to operate as a microRNA  sponge  that  regulates the activity of mRNAs  lncRNAs are also known as competing  endogenous RNAs  ceRNAs . S. Udhaya Kumar  17  focused on finding  dysregulated molecular pathways and key genes that are differentially  regulated in Familial hypercholesterolemia  FH   as well as possible  genetic variables and putative underlying processes that raise the risk of  atherosclerosis in FH individuals.  Although there is strong evidence that there are pathological and  clinically significant connections between AD and HD but the relation   ship has not been thoroughly explored. As a result  the nature of these  linkages is poorly known. Due to the intricacy of AD and HD s etiology   its biological basis  as well as the molecular systems that enable this  association  are still unknown. Furthermore  bioinformatics research  that investigated the association between AD and HD is still insufficient.  Two datasets were used in this research to discover the biological  association between AD and HD. The datasets were obtained from the  Gene Expression Omnibus  GEO  database  with reference codes  GSE53697 and GSE64810 for AD and HD  respectively. At first  differ   entially expressed genes  DEGs  for datasets were identified  and then  common DEGs genes for two diseases were found. In this case  the  common DEGs serve as the key experimental genes for the whole  research. Further experiment and analysis were carried out using these  common DEGs  including     Ontological and functional enrichment analysis to dermine shared  ontologies and pathways.    The network of protein protein interactions  PPIs  formed by the  mutual DEGs.    The transcriptional components of frequent DEGs have been  identified.    A network of protein drug interactions is being developed to find  prospective medications.    The gene disease association network will be used to uncover other  diseases that share similar DEGs.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100888 3So  the main objective of this study was to construct a workflow  depending on bioinformatics methods for detecting potential associa   tions between AD and HD. Determining the nature of these linkages may  provide light on the molecular processes behind these illnesses and may  ultimately contribute to the discovery of possible treatments that may  result in the creation of disease modifying drugs. Fig. 1 illustrates the  sequential workflow of our research.  2.Materials and procedures  2.1. Datasets utilized in this research  The National Center for Biotechnology Information  s  NCBI  GEO  database  https   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov geo     18  was used in this  study for assessing the shared genomic interrelationships between AD and HD. We used an RNA seq dataset for Alzheimer  s disease and a  microarray dataset for Huntington  s disease. The Alzheimer dataset was   GEO accession ID  GSE53697  human brain tissue comprising eight  advanced Alzheimer  s disease brain instances and nine normal samples  which was processed using the high throughput sequencing function   ality known as Illumina HiSeq  Homo sapiens   19 . The Huntington  s  dataset  GEO accession ID  GSE64810  was compiled from human  post mortem BA9 brain tissue  which included 49 samples from neuro   logically normal individuals and 20 samples from Huntington  s disease  patients. We used a common platform GEO2R tool  20  for analysis the  Huntington  s dataset. The Dataset was contributed by Labadorf et al.   21 . Table 1 contains the summarized information of the datasets.

Mahbub et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100888 42.2. Identification of DEGs and mutual DEGs between AD and HD  The purpose of differential expression analysis is to explore out  which genes are expressed at various levels under different conditions   22 . These genes can provide biological insight into the processes that  are impacted by the state of interest  23 . The datasets were processed in  R language  version 3.6.1  and Bioconductor platforms to find DEGs in  AD and HD based on their linked controls. Firstly  we normalized the  gene expression data employing the log2 transform and statistical  techniques. To control rate of false discovery we used  Limma  package  from R programming language with Benjamini Hochberg correction   24 . The important DEGs were determined using P value less than 0.05  and a  logFC  F1. The common DEGs of GSE53697 and GSE64810 were  obtained using the Jvenn online VENN analysis tool  25 .  2.3. Assessment of gene ontologies and pathway enrichment  Gene set enrichment evaluation is a crucial experimental endeavor  that attempts to identify basic biological observation such as biological  processes or chromosome locations correlated with various inter  connected diseases  26 . Gene ontology and pathway enrichment eval  uations were used to deduce the relevant biological concepts and  signaling pathways underlying frequent DEGs. The research utilized  EnrichR  https   amp.pharm.mssm.edu Enrichr    a commonly used  online platform for gene set enrichment  27 . The three types of gene  ontology  GO  and functional process are biological process  cellular  component  and molecular function. To find common pathways between  AD and HD  we used the KEGG  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Ge  nomes   WikiPathways  Reactome  and BioCarta databases as sources of  pathway annotations. For all analyses  a significant margin was esti  mated to be a p value D0.05.  2.4. Determining transcription factors and miRNAs that interact with  mutual DEGs  In order to control gene transcription  transcription factors attach to  specific DNA patterns. Transcription factor attachment regions are  shorter DNA patterns  5 20 bp in length  that are selectively associated  by one or several transcription factors  28 . Identifying transcription  factor binding locations and predicting their roles remain tough computational biology tasks.  We utilized the NetworkAnalyst tool for identifying topologically  plausible TFs binding to shared DEGs in the JASPAR database. JASPAR  is the freely accessible database of TF profiles from multiple species  across six taxonomic groups  29 . The associations of miRNAs with their  specific genes were investigated in order to detect miRNAs that try to  attach to a gene expression in order to inhibit protein production  30 .  The primary databases for experimentally validated miRNA target as  sociations are Tarbase  31  and mirTarbase  32 . Using Network Ana  lyst s topological analysis  we discovered important miRNAs from  Tarbase and mirTarbase.  2.5. Network assessment of protein  protein interactions  PPIs   In all organisms  PPIs are critical for cellular functions and biological  processes. The exploration of protein interactions will contribute to a  deeper understanding of infection pathways  as well as the identification  of multiple medication drugs and treatment optimization  32 . The PPI  network of proteins generated by mutual DEGs was constructed using  the STRING Protein Protein Interaction database  version 11.0   htt  ps   string db.org     33  to reflect how our specified DEGs  as well as  proteins  communicate physically and functionally with each other. The  annotation of protein interactions in STRING  https   string db.org     varies according to levels of medium confidence  33 . We set the lowest  score confidence criterion to produce the PPI network sharply due to the  small number of common DEGs. The Network Analyst web resource was  used to conduct network analysis  34 .  2.6. Assessment of protein drug interactions  DrugBank  v5.0  is a fascinating internet based database of  comparative drug records. Simultaneously  it offers information on the  impact of drugs on protein expression  35 . We utilized NetworkAnalyst  to conduct protein drug interactions in order to find possible in  teractions between our common DEGs and medicines in the DrugBank  dataset  34 .  2.7. Gene  disease association assessment  DisGeNET is a standardized database for gene  disease association  that integrates relationships from multiple sources involving different  biomedical aspects of illnesses. It highlights the growing understanding  of human genetic disorders  36 . We have used network analyst to  examine the gene disease interaction in order to identify diseases and  chronic complications correlated with common DEGs  34 .  3.Result  3.1. Detection of DEGs and mutual DEGs between AD and HD  To evaluate the relationship between AD and HD  we used the NCBI  s  human RNA seq dataset for AD and microarray data for HD. The in  vestigations on the RNA seq and microarray datasets were conducted  using two packages from R programming language called the DESeq2  and limma  with the Benjamin Hochberg false discovery rate. We  examined significant DEGs depending on p values lower than 0.05 and    logFC  higher than 1. In the AD dataset  we identified 308 significant  DEGs  with 100 and 208 DEGs being substantially up regulated and  down regulated  respectively. In HD  we obtained 1655 significant DEGs  in the similar manner that 894 DEGs were up regulated and 761 DEGs  were down regulated  DEGs along with the p value and logFC values for  both the datasets added as supplementary files . We utilized the Jvenn  utility to do a cross comparison in order to find shared DEGs between  AD and HD. As a result  we discovered that AD and HD share 24 common  DEGs. Fig. 2A depicts the overall cross comparison between two data  bases in order to obtain common DEGs between AD and HD.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100888 7and a bubble plot Fig. 2B D depict the distinct transcriptional signature  caused by AD and HD. Two genes  CCL2 and MOG  are often dysregu   lated in AD and HD. These findings indicate that  while AD and HD have similar transcriptomic profiles  the CCL2 and MOG genes are shared by  both diseases. In Table 2 shows  each common gene is listed with its p   value and logFC value.  3.2. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment assessment  Enrichr was used to conduct gene ontology and pathway enrichment  analysis to determine the clinical function and enriched pathways  illustrated in this investigation that associated DEGs. Gene ontology  takes into account gene functions and their components in order to  incorporate complete quantifiable knowledge assets. Additionally   ontology and annotation are designed to facilitate the execution of a  complicated biological structure model  which is often employed in  biomedical activities  37 . The gene ontology study was performed in 3  areas  biological process  cellular component  and molecular function    using annotations derived from the GO database. The bubble graph in  Fig. 3 A C  displays the overall ontology assessment for each group. The  main significant ontology was cellular response to interferon gamma   interferon gamma mediated signaling pathway  positive regulation of  leukocyte cell cell adhesion  T cell receptor signaling pathway  inter  leukin 17 receptor activity  chitinase activity  MHC class II receptor  activity  MHC protein complex  integral component of lumenal side of  endoplasmic reticulum membrane  COPII coated ER to Golgi transport  vesicle  MHC class II protein complex etc.  Pathways assessment demonstrates how the organism responds to  the inherent changes. It acts as a model technique for demonstrating  how different diseases interact through fundamental molecular or bio  logical processes  38 . Four worldwide databases  KEGG  WikiPath   ways  Reactome  and BioCarta  were used to extract the most affected  pathways of common DEGs between AD and HD. Fig. 4 depicted the  Fig. 5.PPI network of DEGs shared by AD and HD. The circle nodes in the  diagram represent DEGs  and the edges represent node interactions. String was  used to create the PPI network  which was then visualized in Cytoscape.  Fig. 6.Identification of hub genes from the PPI network utilizing the Cytohubba plugin in Cytosacpe. To extract hub genes  the new MCC protocol of the Cytohubba  plugin was used. The largest nodes in this diagram represent the top ten hub genes and their intermolecular interactions. The network is made up of 24 nodes and  159 edges. N.I.

Here  Antigen processing  and presentation  Allograft rejection  Graft versus host disease  Ebola  Virus Pathway on Host  Mammary gland development pathway  Inter  feron gamma signaling  Translocation of ZAP 70 to Immunological  synapse  Phosphorylation of CD3 and TCR zeta chains were the signifi   cant pathway.  3.3. Hub protein identification  In order to anticipate typical DEG connections and attachment  pathways  we examined the STRING PPI network and displayed it in  Cytoscape. The PPI network of frequent DEGs shown in Fig. 5 contains  27 nodes and 173 edges.  At the same time  several interconnected nodes in a PPI network are  recognized as hub genes. The leading 10 DEGs were identified as the  most influential genes based on a study of the PPI network utilizing the  Cytohubba plugin in Cytoscape. The hub genes are B2M  HLA A  HLA E   HLA B  HLA C  HLA F  CANX  HLA DQA1  HLA DRA  and HLA DRB1.  This hub genes can be important biomarkers  leading to novel thera   peutic methods for diseases under investigation. Since hub genes have  potential  we built a submodule network  Fig. 6  with the help of the  Cytohubba plugin to better understand their close communication and  proximity.  3.4. Identifying transcription factors and miRNAs that interact with  mutual DEGs  A network based method was applied to decipher the regulatory TFs   and miRNAs of hub proteins  and the DEGs TFs and DEGs miRNA linkages networks were examined to identify transcriptional and post   transcriptional regulatory fingerprints of similar DEGs. The associa   tions involving DEGs and TFs are illustrating in Fig. 7. The correlations  between DEGs and miRNAs also appear in Fig. 8.

Identification of candidate drugs  The objective was to find candidate drugs that could potentially  affect AD and HD while also investigating the protein drug interaction.  Analysis of protein drug interactions is essential to understand the  characteristics necessary to sensitive receptors  39 . The interaction  analysis between the protein and drug revealed the drug  s interaction  with a hub protein. Fig. 9 shows two drug molecules  called Pyroglu   tamic Acid and Beta D Glucose associate with the hub proteins of  KRTAP5 2.  3.6. Identification of gene disease association  The assumption that various disorders can be associated or linked  with each other is that they generally have one or more common genes   40 . Disorder specific therapeutic interface techniques attempt  uncovering the connection between genes and disorders. According to  Network Analyst  s study of the gene disease relationship  Schizo   phrenia  Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury  Asthma  Multiple  Sclerosis  Celiac Disease  and Brain Ischeia disorders are the most  Fig. 7.DEGs TFs Common DEG interaction network created via Network Analyst.

Fig. 10 depicts the connection  involving genes and disease.  4.Discussion  We explored gene activity data from Alzheimer  s and Parkinson  s  disease patients in this experiment. We utilized bioinformatics pipelines  to describe genes that are dysregulated in both illnesses and may serve as  potential treatment candidates or diagnostic biomarkers. Microarray  datasets for HD and RNA seq datasets for AD were employed to examine  candidate biomarker genes. The statistical study of the AD and HD  transcriptomics showed 24 DEGs with identical expression variations in  the two diseases. Gene Ontology  GO  and pathway evaluation were  utilized to obtain understanding into the biological significance of these  shared genes in the pathogenesis of AD and HD. The Gene Ontology   GO  model is a comprehensive theoretical framework in the field of  gene expression that specifies gene activities and interactions. It pro  gresses incrementally via the collection of scientific knowledge  regarding gene functions and regulation  which is contingent on various  ontological categories and language connections across classes  41 .  Enrichr was utilized for gene ontology exploration of common genes across three divisions  biological  cellular  molecular  and an ontolog   ical annotation source was used for the GO database. According to GO   42   biological mechanisms are instances of molecular interactions.  The cell part is the cellular form in which the gene controls its ac  tivity  and the molecular notion refers to molecular activities. The  pathway analysis is a new strategy that explores and reveals how bio  logically or molecularly complicated disorders are linked. The pathway  is the optimal way to achieve the responses of an organism that are  caused by internal changes  43 . Gene ontology and the pathway study  revealed many mechanisms involved with neurodegenerative diseases.  However  this integrative study has succeeded in identifying additional  major proteins or hub proteins shared between these two illnesses. It  suggests other research paths  such as possible preventative treatments  for novel uses.  PPIs experiments are often performed to reach essential illness   related signaling molecules and pathways which might amplify dis  ease facets  44 . Therefore  we conduct a PPI investigation to determine  critical hub proteins. B2M  HLA A  HLA E  HLA B  HLA C  HLA F  CANX   HLA DQA1  HLA DRA  and HLA DRB1 were identified as 10 hub pro  teins. In this study  we identified the respective proteins encoded be  tween AD and HD by common DEGs.  Fig. 8.DEGs miRNA Common DEG interaction network created via NetworkAnalyst.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100888 10In  45  mentioned  only HD information about gene expression and  miRNA is provided. Whereas in our study  we examined the hub gene   pathway analysis  gene ontology  potential drug target  and gene disease  association with miRNA and TFs both HD and AD.  Kang revealed that TEMRA cells from Alzheimer  s disease patients  had proinflammatory  IFN  and TNF  and cytotoxic activities  NKG7   GZMA  and B2M   46 . Huntington  s expression was determined using  2CT with  2 microglobulin  B2M  as the reference in Ref.  47 . HLA A  alleles were shown to be linked with a higher chance of obtaining AD  in a Chinese population studied by the authors of  48 . According to the  authors   results  a subpopulation of brain cells known as angiogenic  endothelial cells is produced in Alzheimer  s patients. Increased amounts  of angiogenic expansion elements are present in these angiogenic  epithelial units and recipients  EGFL7  FLT1  and VWF   as well as  antigen presenting components  i.e.  B2M and HLA E   49 . HLA A and  HLA C were the most prevalent HLA class   I genotypes in both AD pa  tients and the overall population  50 . HLA F also implicated in  neurotransmission  giving fresh insights into the underlying process   51 . The authors discovered dramatically changed expression of  HLA DRA and IPMK in Alzheimer disease brains compared to normal  brains using a gene expression data set  52 . Genome wide association  studies  GWAS  have identified rs9271192  a single nucleotide poly  morphism  SNP  within HLA DRB1  as a potential marker for AD in  Caucasians  53 . A common biomarker is attempting to suppress the  elevated signals associated with AD and HD targeted therapy. Gene  regulation involves both transcriptional and post transcriptional stages of regulatory control. Bioinformatics methods were used to identify the  most important genes  miRNAs  DEG miRNA interactions  and their  associated pathways in AD and HD  54 . As a result  our defined genes  and microRNAs may be used in future molecular studies of AD and HD.  To classify DEG regulatory molecules  we examined the important reg  ulatory molecules TF and miRNAs. Regarding DEGs TF interaction  we  established the top five transcription factors  which are MUC20   KRTAP5 2  NOL4L  GSTA1  and CCL2. According to Xiaoyu Dong  55    the miRNA network revealed that hsa miR 4488  hsa miR 196a 5p  and  hsa miR 549a had a high degree and may be involved in HD etiology  and possible treatment targets. Messenger RNAs are targeted by  microRNAs  which are small  22 nt  RNA molecules that disrupt their  synthesis. Thus  miRNAs control DEGs in this manner. By providing a  comprehensive view of the regulatory mechanism networks underlying  TFs  the current research establishes potential molecule targets for ge  netic counseling and prenatal diagnosis of TFs  55 . According to Zhang   56   future advancements and challenges will be discussed  including  more powerful bioinformatics approaches and high throughput tech  nologies for TF and miRNA target prediction  as well as the integration  of multilevel networks. Nowadays  miRNAs are gaining prominence as  biomarkers in a variety of complex diseases  including cancer.  Mir 10b 5p  mir 941  mir 107  mir 330 3p  mir 26a 5p  mir 34a 5p   mir 26b 5p  mir 124 3p  mir 101 3p  and mir 148 3p are the top 10  regulatory miRNAs identified in our study.  The study of the gene disease interaction network identified the  comorbid disorders linked to the hub genes. The most synchronized  diseases to our identified hub genes are Schizophrenia  Chemical and  Drug Induced Liver Injury  Asthma  Multiple Sclerosis  Celiac Disease   and Brain Ischemia.  Finally  in order to find new drugs that target the hub proteins  we  explored protein drug interactions and discovered that Pyroglutamic  Acid and Beta D Glucose drug molecules associate with the hub protein  KRTAP5 2. More investigation is required to determine the significance  of these medicines in the diagnosis of AD and HD.  5.Conclusion  In this research  we employed a bioinformatics method to examine  gene expression transcriptomic profiles in order to identify possible  biomarkers that could clarify critical pathobiological pathways influ  encing AD and HD. We used overlap  core connection  and gene filtering  to identify the shared responsive gene between AD and HD.  Following that  we determined signaling pathways and gene  ontology processes and then presented a PPI network for shared genes.  We utilized transcriptional analysis to determine DEG miRNA associa   tions as well as protein protein interactions. The protein  drug and  protein  chemical association networks illustrate how pharmacological  and chemical substances interact with certain genes. As a result  our  methodology will help to push the decision making process ahead in the  field of personalized healthcare. Despite our best efforts  this research  contains flaws. The sample size for certain illness studies may be inad  equate to describe all of the essential disease associated genes required  to determine frequent DEGs. As such  additional investigation may be  necessary to properly evaluate the biological significance of the prob  able intended possibilities reported in this research.
