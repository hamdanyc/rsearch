However  zoo  noses surveillance data are collected individually from standalone information systems for either humans or  animals with varied structures  processes and applications. In moving towards one health  OH  surveillance   integrating the zoonoses data may help prevent and control these diseases. Therefore  this research aimed to  determine essential data elements and a consistent reporting template towards interoperability.  Material and methods  In this study  first  the zoonotic diseases minimum dataset  ZD MDS  was identified ac  cording to a comprehensive literature review coupled with the agreements of experts. Then  the ZD MDS was  mapped to structured clinical vocabularies. Also  the health level seven clinical document architecture  HL7   CDA  standard was used to define the interoperable and human machine reporting template.  Results  The ZD MDS was divided into administrative and clinical sections with five and seven data classes and  total of 38 and 57 data elements  respectively. Then  the corresponding data values and systematized nomen   clature of medicine clinical terms  SNOMED CT  codes were defined for each data element. The reporting  template was structured according to three sections of CDA template  extensible markup language  XML  hier  archical and tags.  Conclusion  Our study suggested that zoonoses surveillance could be improved by integrating and exchanging  data from different databases across humans and animal organizations. The developed template provided a  comprehensive and interoperable dataset  making data more comparable and reportable across multiple studies  and settings.    1.Introduction  Zoonotic diseases or zoonoses are contagious diseases that are  naturally transmissible from animal hosts  usually vertebrates  to the  human population  or vice versa  1 2 . Statistically  it is appraised that  nearly 60  of pathogens affecting humans are of animal origin. More  than 70  of novel pathogens likely to be used in bioterrorism attacks are  zoonosis  3 4 . Despite developing preventive and controlling strategies  for zoonoses management  many countries  including Iran  suffer from a  widespread outbreak of these diseases  5 6 . Most of the emerging  zoonotic diseases  including extremely pathogenic avian influenza   NIPA virus  Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus  MERS CoV   severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS   Coronavirus disease 2019   COVID 19  and pH1N1  H1N1 epidemic   have triggered severe con  tagions worldwide  7 . Zoonotic diseases also constitute a significant  and devastating threat to the public health and the globalization trade of  animal and animal products. Still  their influence is often mis  apprehended due to inadequate surveillance measures and lack of suf  ficient data on their significance and burden  8 10 . In Iran  due to  isolated organizational performance  weak and traditional surveillance  and reporting systems  traditional agriculture and livestock breeding   climate changes and rural living have caused a substantial proportion of  contagious diseases to be zoonotic  11 .

To prepare for and deal with large numbers of incoming  reports and alerts from humans  animals and foodstuff for surveillance  purposes  setting a well established and integrated surveillance system  is of great importance  which provides close collaboration among gov  erning authorities to direct disease control and prevention efforts   12 15 .  As stated by world health organization  WHO   an efficient surveil   lance system should be able to perform some functions such as identi   fying and informing health events  collecting and integrating relevant  data  investigating and confirming cases or outbreaks  creating and  analyzing routine reports  providing feedback to data providers  feed   forwarding and reporting data to macro level health policymakers   16 . Since zoonoses affect both human and animal populations  it is  presumed that their surveillance should  at least for some purposes   target both populations and integrate the collected data among them  3   17 18 . Moreover  given that human and animal health are closely  interrelated and the costs of assembling new data are high  the inte  gration and reuse of these routinely collected data might be useful for  improving the surveillance of zoonoses  19 20 . This type of surveil   lance can be referred to as one health  OH  surveillance. The OH  approach aims to provide collaboration and communication between  multiple disciplines such as wildlife biologists  veterinarians  physicians   agriculturists  ecologists  microbiologists  epidemiologists and biomed   ical engineers to achieve optimal health for humans  animals and the  environment  21 22 . The requirements and returns of multi sectoral  communication to resolve human and animal health qualms are obvious  but the traditional  social and economical variances among  sectors still exist as significant barriers  23 24 . Moreover  challenges  concerning tasks  data exchanging and confidentiality limitations still  represent hurdles for well organized and unconstrained teamwork.  Furthermore  basic things like scientific vocabulary and descriptions  have been created separately in each department over time  compli   cating communication and collaboration between the parties involved in  the health of human beings  animals and the environment  24 26 .  Currently  there is no interoperable surveillance system for imple   menting OH surveillance in Iran for integrating data from involved or  ganizations  27 . Thus  with the widespread outbreak of zoonoses   especially the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic  establishing an integrated  and interoperable surveillance system is more required to facilitate  detection and track new cases  investigate causes and control outbreak  of zoonoses diseases  28 29 . Scientific experience proves that devel   oping a well designed ZDSS holds a large share in controlling zoonosis  and preventing devastating human outbreaks. In addition  it supports  the strengthening of public health settings for coordination  manage   ment  monitoring and evaluation of zoonoses  30 31 . Likewise  the  effectiveness of ZDSS depends on data and reports from wide scattered  public health and clinical related information systems as data input.  Depending on the source and purpose of collecting zoonoses data  this  data is stored in isolated databases from different human and animal  organizations  32 . In this sense  a consistent minimum dataset  MDS  is  one of the key steps in establishing a collaborative surveillance system  across organizations to increase inter sectional and scientific collabo   rations  33 36 . As stated by Kowal et al.  MDS is an agreement set of  data items used for uniform data collection  37 . Some studies have  stressed the importance of MDS to implement national information  systems and support data exchange across health information sectors   38 39 . Thus  the present study  first  aimed to develop zoonotic disease  minimum datasets  ZD MDS  as a basic step for implementing the ZDSS.  Second  it presented an exchanging framework toward interoperability  between zoonotic diseases information systems  ZDISs .  2.Material and Methods  This descriptive and cross sectional study was conducted in three  phases as follows   2.1. Literature review  Firstly  we performed a systematic literature review to define the  zoonoses potential data elements. In this phase  to retrieve full text  related articles up to October 21st  2020  scientific databases such as  PubMed  web of science  WOS   Science Direct  Scopus and ProQuest  were reviewed through the English MeSH keywords    zoonotic   OR   zoonosis   OR  zoonoses   AND   surveillance system   OR  information  system   OR  registry system   AND   data element   OR  data set  OR   data field  . After setting the advanced search options  search formula   and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria  search filter or refine  result   the titles and abstracts of the potentially relevant studies were  identified. Letters  posters  conference papers  review studies  lectures   duplicated  non English and articles published before 2010 were  excluded. Details of the search strategy are shown in Table 1.  2.2.

Then  a researcher made questionnaire was  designed using the potential data items with five columns in front of  each data item. To determine the final ZD MDS  an expert panel was  considered  including 20 specialists working in Ilam and Abadan uni  versities of medical sciences  as common areas of zoonotic diseases in  Iran  with at least three years of work experience and research back  ground in zoonotic diseases. The panel of experts included five parasi   tologists  three PhD  and two MSc holders   five epidemiologists  four  PhD  and one MSc holders   five public health practitioners  one MSc  and four BSc holders and five infectious disease specialists. The median  age of the 20 participants  of whom 13 were male and 7 were female   was 43 years old  range  23 58 years old . Using a two rounded Delphi  technique  the participants were asked to score each item according to  the importance perceived by them based on a five point Likert scale  ranging from one  very low importance  to five  very high importance    1 . At the end of each section  a blank row was considered for adding  necessary data elements by experts.

Test retest reliability  with a 10 day interval  was  performed to determine the reliability of the questionnaire. The  collected data was analyzed using SPSS version 19 and Spearman  s rank  correlation coefficient of 84  was achieved. Through a Delphi tech  nique in two rounds  deciding on included data items was based on the  agreement level. In this way  data items with less than 50  agreement   the average score of less than 2.5  were excluded  first  and those with  more than 75  agreement  the average score of above 3.75  were  included in the preliminary rounds. Data elements were surveyed with  50   75  agreement  the average score between 2.5 and 3.75  in the  second round and 75  agreement on one issue was considered the final  data element.  2.3. Sematic and syntax validation  In our study  after designing the MDS of zoonotic diseases  its content  was standardized through comprehensive standard and integrated  codes. NPEX browser software was used to link the contents to the  systematized nomenclature of medicine clinical terminology  SNOMED   CT  structure. After content standardization  the structure standardiza   tion was done. For this purpose  a clinical document architecture  CDA   format  which is specifically the exchange of clinical documents  was  used. In addition  extensible markup language  XML  codes were used  for labeling.  The data element content was standardized using SNOMED CT  browser  entitled NPEX online browser  https   snomedbrowser.com    . SNOMED CT was used  as the most comprehensive  precise and  structured clinical terminology for electronic healthcare information  exchange  HIE   40 41 . The SNOMED CT NPEX conceptual categories  were classified into 20 classes including administrative  observable en  tity  qualifier value  staging scale  body structure  organism  record  artifact  substance  environment  physical force  situation  event  phys  ical object  social concept  finding  procedure  unique concept  linkage  concept  product  specimen and additional filter  Fig. 1 .  This process was visualized through Mind maple Lite 1.71 applica   tion software as a graphic user interface  representing thesaurus map  ping across multiple medical terminologies. Then  the integrated  SNOMED CT codes were structured into an approved messaging stan  dard framework to provide syntactic interoperability. The health level  seven clinical document architecture  HL7 CDA  standard was proposed  as an optimal and consistent structure for the zoonoses surveillance  system. Accordingly  integrated reference codes were structured into  HL7 CDA standard framework to provide syntactic coordination.  3.Results  3.1. Identifying the proposed data field  The present systematic review was reported according to the  preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analysis   PRISMA  standard which describes the identification  screening  eligi  bility and inclusion criteria of the articles falling under the scope of the review  42 .  The initial search in the selected scientific database yielded 248 ci  tations  142 of which remained after omitting the duplicates and 53 of  which remained after removing non English  those published before  2010 or after 2020 and the document type ones  editorial  commentary   report  case study and conference paper . Twenty one articles  17   27 46  were identified as eligible studies to meet our criteria in the last  screening phase. Full text articles were obtained for the detailed eval  uation and eligible studies were included in the systematic review   Fig. 2 .  The designed ZD MDS structure in this study included data cate  gories  classes and fields. After the literature review  the proposed  dataset was divided into 11 classes including basic data  43 56   ID  numbers  46 48 52 57 59   geospatial data  43 46 50 56 58 60 61    environmental data  27 47 53 54 58 59   disease parameters  46 51   54 55 58 59 61 62   clinical risk factors  43 46 47 49 51 57 61 62    physical examination  43 45 48 50 52 53 62   exposure data  43 44 50   51 53 55 57   laboratory data  27 44 45 47 50 51 53 54 60 62   treat  ment plan  27 43 45 48 51 53 55 57 61  and discharge information   46 49 52 53 57 . These classes contained 19 14  6  9  21  14  6  9  10   13 and 7 data items  respectively  n  128 .  3.2. identifying the final data field  After the first round of Delphi  from among 128 proposed data fields   78 fields were finalized  36 fields entered the second round and 14 fields  were excluded from the study. Finally  out of 36 data fields in the second  round  19 fields were excluded. While the final ZD MDS comprised two  sections  with 11 data classes and 95 data items  the administrative  section consisted of four classes and 38 data items. The clinical section  contained seven classes and 57 data items  Tables 2 and 3 .  3.3. Content and structure validation  All the scattered terms were mapped to integrated codes in the  SNOMED CT reference nomenclature system using NPEx online  browser. The SNOMED CT conceptual framework for the total of 95 data  fields in the proposed ZD MDS was classified into 20 conceptual cate  gories  including observable entity  23   qualifier value  15   organism   1   substance  4   environments and geographical location  3   situa  tion  2   events  2   social concept  2   clinical finding  35   procedure   3   unique concept 3   linkage concept 1  and specimen  1 . All the  mapping routes were displayed through MindMaple software  Fig. 3 .  After content standardization by integrating SNOMED CT codes  the  zoonoses report structure was designed in three layers  1 free text CDA  templates  first CDA level   2  XML hierarchical  second CDA level  and  XML tags  syntax   third CDA level .  3.3.1. Free text CDA  The XML based CDA framework of the HL7 V3 messaging standard  was leveraged to standardize clinical documents in the web environ   ment.

CDA uses a logical structure for data classifi   cation and arrangement according to a standardized and predefined  structure. In the present CDA structure  Fig. 4   the data field related to  identifying entities such as general data  identifier and report data was  pasted into the document heading. The body contained detailed infor  mation about geospatial and environmental  diagnostic  treatment plan   exposure  history and discharge information.  3.3.2. XML tree  The XML standard is used to define structuring  validation as well as  organization and standardize documents in the network compatible  format for transmission. It creates a structured data format for elec  tronic data exchange over the Internet . An XML hierarchy is a tree like  structure where elements are arranged by parent child or containment  relationships  contains contained . Each XML document has a  root  or   parent   which  contains   all the other elements  child and sub class . In  our XML structure  the ZDSS is the root node  which contains three  classes  basic  geospatial and clinical data classes with 12 sub class.  Fig. 5 displays the hierarchical structure of the XML with leaf nodes   sub classes  for the nonclinical category.  3.3.3. XML syntax  The tags are the important features of an XML document that  structure  label and organize the message structure. They provide data  for XML by defining each data section  performing accurate organization  and labeling data elements for transmission in the web environment. In  the present study  the XML tags defined the scope of elements in the  ZDSS document  see Fig. 6 .  4.Discussion  In this study  first  the ZD MDS was presented  including the required  data items for unified recording and reporting zoonoses surveillance  data. The proposed ZD MDS provided human  animal  food and agri  cultural sectors and their stockholders with a comprehensive and  consensus dataset for unified reporting zoonoses data across various settings and software systems. Second  by leveraging HL7 CDA standard  and terminology mapping  the ZD MDS would become a communication  protocol towards integrating isolated zoonoses related databases and  information systems.  Ammon et al.  2010  designed the European surveillance system   TESSy  that reported the cases based on three human  animal and food  data classes. They suggested an XML based zoonoses reporting appli   cation substitute for paper reporting until the fully automatic and  interoperable transmission is in place  63 . Scotch et al.  2013  pro  posed a ZDSS framework in four general  geographical   clinical para clinical and environmental wildlife data classes. Besides   they designed a semantic web approach to promoting online resources  and concepts  64 . Wendt et al.  2015  developed ZD MDS in two  clinical and nonclinical categories  providing customized data and  messaging standards was a key prerequisite for OH ZDSS establishment   55 . Das et al.  2019  developed a web based zoonotic registry template  based on the HL7 standard with four demographical  exposure  envi  ronmental and diagnostic testing sections  65 . Omazic  2019  devel   oped a standardized template for reporting zoonotic infectious diseases  in three basic  clinical and animal food data categories. In that study   the interoperability requirements were not met  66 . Muligan et al.   2019  developed the zoonoses data model in six prevalence  antimi   crobial resistance  food borne outbreak  animal population and disease  status classes. They used the EFSA  s standard terminology and XML  structural standard for semantic and syntax interoperability  respec   tively  67 . Shapiro  2021  presented a framework for content  normalization of zoonotic data for information exchange on the Internet.  Accordingly in the present study  after designing MDS as a basic func  tion  all the interoperability requirements were met through semantic   data mapping  and syntax  CDA based XML  standardization  68 .  Well established and standardized information systems for zoonoses  reporting would improve interoperability  reusability  integrity  reli  ability and quality data criteria  thus eliminating unnecessary re  dundancies and reporting burden on public health agencies.  Interoperable ZDSS can thus help improve the standardization of sci  entific research to successfully combat the diseases pandemic  29 46   Fig. 3.Mapping routes.  M. Shanbehzadeh et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100893 952 . Our study used the reference terminology tools to normalize zoo  noses reporting. To this end  all the data elements were mapped into  their SNOMED CT unique codes  then  according to the HL7 CDA stan  dard  the zoonoses communication protocol was developed. HL7 CDA is  a simplified and optimal human computer comprehensible format   playing a crucial role in exchanging a wide variety of clinical data. Be  sides  this standard uses an XML template that provides consistent public  health data exchange by structuring the message framework amid  various systems. The developed zoonotic diseases reporting communi   cation protocol in the present study can be used as a standard tool for  developing an interoperable ZDSS. This communication protocol can  enable interoperability among public health and veterinary information  systems that populate the ZDSS. The main output of the proposed  communication protocol supported partnerships between numerous  healthcare providers and public health agencies for patient care man  agement  epidemiological research and public health purposes. The  most important limitation of the present study was that it only focused  on the information management aspect of the ZDSS. Still  the technical  and legal aspects remained to be resolved. However  the interoperability  level considered in this study went beyond the basic level  machine    portable data  and reached high interoperability  machine interpretable  data . Furthermore  the ZD MDS might need to be assessed from the  standpoints of a larger assembly of medical and public health experts to be valid nationwide.  5.Conclusion  Proper and effective surveillance of zoonotic diseases demands  timely and useful evidence for guiding fully informed decisions to  further propagate diseases by taking early preparedness and preventive  actions. The proposed template in our study can help healthcare pro  viders  public health experts  healthcare authorities and researchers  with an inclusive and coordinated dataset in terms of reporting   exchanging and analyzing zoonoses data across organizations and soft  ware systems  as major purposes for OH surveillance  in Iran. We  recommend developing conceptual models of surveillance systems and  conducting a pilot study including a further Delphi stage before refining  some data categories.
