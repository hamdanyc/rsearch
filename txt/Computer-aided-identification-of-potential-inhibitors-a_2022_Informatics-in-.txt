Its harmful effects  include anemia and retarded growth and are common in the tropics. A current control method involves the mass  drug administration of synthetic drugs  mainly albendazole and mebendazole. There are however concerns of  low efficacy and drug resistance due to their repeated and excessive use. Although  Necator americanus gluta   thione S transferase 3  Na GST 3  is a notable target  using natural product libraries for computational eluci  dation of promising leads is underexploited. This study sought to use pharmacoinformatics techniques to identify  compounds of natural origins with the potential to be further optimized as promising inhibitors. A compendium  of 3182 African natural products together with five known helminth GST inhibitors including Cibacron blue was  screened against the active sites of the Na GST 3 structure  PDB ID  3W8S . The hit compounds were profiled to  ascertain the mechanisms of binding  anthelmintic bioactivity  physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties.  The AutoDock Vina docking protocol was validated by obtaining 0.731 as the area under the curve calculated via  the receiver operating characteristics curve. Four compounds comprising ZINC85999636  ZINC35418176   ZINC14825190  and Dammarane Triterpene13 were identified as potential lead compounds with binding en  ergies less than  9.0 kcal mol. Furthermore  the selected compounds formed key intermolecular interactions  with critical residues Tyr95  Gly13 and Ala14. Notably  ZINC85999636  ZINC14825190  and dammarane tri  terpene13 were predicted as anthelmintics  whilst all the four molecules shared structural similarities with  known inhibitors. Molecular modelling showed that the compounds had reasonably good binding free energies.  More so  they had high binding affinities when screened against other variants of the Na GST  namely Na GST 1  and Na GST 2. Ligand quality assessment using ligand efficiency dependent lipophilicity  ligand efficiency   ligand efficiency scale and fit quality scale showed the molecules are worthy candidates for further optimization.  The inhibitory potentials of the molecules warrant in vitro studies to evaluate their effect on the heme regulation  mechanisms.    1.Introduction  Hookworm infection affects over 500 million people globally  1 2 .

Hookworm infection is prevalent in tropical and sub tropical climates.  Necator americanus   one of the two main hookworm species  accounts for  over 80  of reported hookworm infection cases in sub Saharan Africa   1 . Ghana  a developing country in the tropics  had an estimated  prevalence of 2 993 431 in 2017  5 .  Current hookworm intervention includes the mass drug administra   tion  MDA  of the commonly used drugs benzimidazole derivatives  mebendazole and albendazole  1 . Both drugs bind to the   tubulin of  the parasite and interrupt the parasite  s metabolism  slowly resulting in  their death  6 7 . Binding to the nematode  s   tubulin inhibits poly  merization  thereby preventing the formation of microtubules and so  stopping cell division  8 . Although  this intervention has led to some  degree of success in the past  9   there are increasing reports of  respondence to treatment  10 14  which has been linked to mutations  in   tubulin  15 .  Therefore  new drugs with different modes of binding and mecha   nisms of action are urgently needed to circumvent the concerns of mu  tations in   tubulin  16 . Hence  new receptors must be explored to  identify a novel class of biotherapeutics. Since exogenous heme is  needed by homoproteins  17   the hookworm employs the glutathione  S transferase  GST  family to detoxify and transport the toxic heme. By  pairing to form a homodimer  the GST creates a specific pocket capable  of binding the heme  18 . Inhibiting the glutathione S transferase 3 of  Necator americanus  Na GST 3   will deprive the parasite of its major  detoxification system  19  with possible death. Therefore  Na GST 3 is  considered a druggable target  19 21   warranting its use in this study.  It plays a role in detoxifying toxic reactive oxidative species  ROS   19 .  Blood of the host containing haemoglobin enters the lumen of the  hookworm  further undergoes a cascade of mechanisms which finally  results in the release of heme. The heme produced is ROS  hence toxic to  the hookworm  18 . The nematode specific nu class GSTs act as heme  regulators  22 . A key distinguishing factor between nematode specific  nu class GST and other GSTs  including humans  is the flexibility at the  H site  resulting in different substrate specificity  19 . Moreover   Na GST 3 has a wider binding cavity relative to the other Na GSTs   enabling it to bind to a wider array of ligands  19 .  Natural products have served as treatment options for helminth in  fections  23 24 . They are chemically diverse and are naturally bioactive   25 . Current drug discovery efforts employ the use of natural products  as scaffolds  26 . The conventional methods used in the drug discovery  pipeline are expensive and time consuming  27 . Pharmacoinformatics  has evolved as an alternative method for drug discovery because it is  cheaper and requires a lesser amount of time  28 .  Our goal was to utilize pharmacoinformatics based techniques to  unravel novel compounds with propensity to disrupt the Na GST 3 heme  regulation process. The study sought to virtually screen a library of  diverse compounds originating from Africa  s vast biodiversity in addi  tion to standard helminth GST inhibitors against Na GST 3. We also  sought to probe into the mechanism of binding as well as to characterize  computationally the anthelmintic propensity and the pharmacological  profiles of these compounds. The molecular mechanics Poisson   Boltzmann surface area  MM PBSA  approach was used to assess the  binding free energies and the energy contributions of the protein ligand  complexes and residues  respectively  29 . Additionally  we screened  selected molecules against other Na GSTs to understand their mecha   nisms of binding.  2.Materials and methods  2.1. Retrieval of protein structure and molecular dynamics  MD   simulation  The solved protein structure of Na GST 3  ID  3W8S   19  was obtained via the Protein Data Bank  30  in a pdb file format. The  structure was preprocessed and visualized using PyMOL 2.0.0  31 . The  structure is preprocessed by removing all available water molecules and  ligands. An MD simulation of the Na GST 3 target structure was per  formed in the GROMACS v.2018  32 . Position restrain files and protein  topology were calculated using GROMOS96 43a1 force field. The pro  tein structure was subjected to Periodic Boundary Conditions  PBC   centered at 1 nm  33 . SPC water and 2Na were used for solvation and  neutralization  respectively. The steps used for minimization of energy  were 50 000 via the steepest descent. Equilibration was undertaken at  100 ps with 1 bar pressure and 300 K temperature via ensembles of NPT  and NVT. The molecular dynamics production run was then performed  for 100 ns and Xmgrace was used to generate output graphs  34 .  2.2. Validation docking parameters  To determine the accuracy of the AutoDock Vina  35  docking pro  tocol  two methods were employed. The first comprises the superim   position of the re docked and co crystallized ligands and the second is  the generation of receiver operating characteristic  ROC  curves to  assess AutoDock Vina. Glutathione  GSH   which binds to the G site at  the highly conserved N terminal was extracted from the crystallographic  structure of Na GST 3  which was then re docked to the G site. The  lowest energy pose of GSH was used in superimposition studies by  juxtaposing it to the original crystallographic GSH. The  root mean square deviation  RMSD  was calculated using LigAlign  36 .  Additionally  to assess the effectiveness of Autodock Vina to distin   guish between decoys and active compounds  the receiver operating  characteristic  ROC  curves were produced  37 . The conventional in  hibitors Cibacron blue and lithocholic acid in addition to other helminth  GST inhibitors comprising ellagic acid  alizarin  and chenodeoxycholic  acid  38  were used as actives. These compounds were used as inputs to  generate decoys with similar physicochemical properties using DUD E  a  Directory of Useful Decoys  39 . For one inhibitor  50 decoys were  generated  but forty five were used for screening after eliminating  redundancy. A library of 230 compounds comprising 5 actives and 225  decoys were screened against the Na GST 3  Na GST 1 and Na GST 2.  Screening Explorer  40  was used to generate the ROC Curve.  2.3. Ligand preparations ands and molecular docking  Molecular docking of the natural compounds against the energy  minimized Na GST 3 was undertaken using AutoDock Vina  35  acces   sible via PyRx  41 . The 3182 African natural compounds were accessed  from the AfroDb  42   a catalogue of the ZINC database  43 44   and the  Northern African Natural Products Database  NANPDB   45 . The  compounds were filtered via the FAFDrugs4  46  to eliminate com  pounds with undesirable functional groups. Additionally  known hel  minth GST inhibitors namely Cibacron blue  ellagic acid  alizarin   chenodeoxycholic acid  and lithocholic acid  38  were also included in  the screening set. The OpenBabel  47  was used for preparing the  compounds  and 200 steps were used for the Universal Force Field  UFF   and optimization was undertaken using the conjugate gradient. A grid  box was specified mainly around the ligand binding H site with  dimension  30.578 X  20.762 Y  38.733 Z    and centered at  44.396   40.678  40.164   . The ligands were docked to the protein with a default  exhaustiveness of 8. The top 5  compounds were then evaluated and  those with low binding energies and appropriate poses were shortlisted.  2.4. Representation of the biomolecular interactions  The intermolecular interactions were obtained using LigPlot  48   and interactively visualized using PyMOL  31 . S.K. Kwofie et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100957 32.5. Evaluating the anthelmintic propensity of compounds  The anthelmintic propensity was computed using the prediction of  activity spectra for substances  PASS   49  and the search for anthel   mintic related structures was performed via DrugBank  50 .  2.6. Pharmacological profiling  The selected top hits  as well as the known inhibitors  were subjected  to in silico pharmacological profiling via SwissADME  51  and Data  Warrior  52 . SwissADME was used to predict the pharmacokinetic and  physicochemical profiles  whereas DataWarrior was used to predict  toxicity  52 . The parameters predicted included donors and acceptors  of hydrogen bonds  molecular weights  absorption in the intestines   Cytochrome P450 inhibition  permeability glycoprotein substrate   tumorigenicity  mutagenicity  irritancy  and reproductive effects.  2.7. Molecular dynamics and MM PBSA calculations  GROMACS v2018  32  was used for the molecular dynamics  MDs   of the complexes. The Na GST 3 topology was generated in GROMACS  using the GROMOS96 43a1  and PRODRG  53  was used for generating  topologies of ligands set at EM  No  Charges  Full  and Chirality  Yes. The  generated topologies were merged with that of the protein to form the  complexes. The production simulations were ran for 100 ns and the free  binding energies were computed using g mmpbsa  29  utilizing frames  in steps of 1 ns.  2.8. Quality assessment of leads  The ligand evaluating metrics used were fit quality  FQ   ligand ef  ficiency  LE   ligand efficiency dependent lipophilicity  LELP  and  ligand efficiency scale  LE Scale . These metrics were computed using  equations  1   4   54 56 .

Protein structure retrieval and molecular dynamics simulation  The X ray structure of Na GST 3 with PDB ID  3W8S  19  solved at a  resolution of 2.07   was used for structural analysis. The Na GST 3  monomer has a ligand binding H site as well as glutathione binding  G site  19 . The G site residues are identical to those in other organisms  since the G site is highly conserved  19 . However  the ligand binding  H site is responsible for the varying substrate specificity across organ   isms  19 . A surface representation of the structure was generated using  PyMOL  31  and it shows the ligand binding H site and glutathione  bound to the G site  Fig. 1 .  MD is a computational technique employed in predicting the time   dependent behavior of the molecular system  57 . Minimization of the  Na GST 3 protein structure before MD ran reduced potential energy and  eliminated inappropriate geometry  58  with the maximum force less  than the allowable tolerance set before the energy minimization step. Initial potential energy  Epot  of approximately  4.5  105 kJ mol was  observed to decrease exponentially and converged around   8.3  105  kJ mol  Fig. 2a . Epot value of  8.2  105 kJ mol was obtained after  minimization for 1000 ps. Moreover  the maximum force converged to  9.5  102 kJ mol  which was lower than the allowable tolerance of  1000 kJ mol  denoting a successful energy minimization step.  Furthermore  the protein stability during the MD simulation was  evaluated by computing the RMSD  which accounted for the deviations  of the protein atoms and the protein backbone  59 . The plot of the  RMSD  Fig. 2b  showed a steep increase from 0.00 to 0.41 nm within the  first 6 ns. It then fluctuated between 0.38 nm and 0.50 nm averaging at  0.44 nm. Furthermore  radius of gyration  Rg   a means of calculating  the compactness of the structure and atom distribution of atoms to its  centroid was computed  60 . The radius of gyration decreased sharply  from 0.1725 nm to around 0.16 nm during the first 10000 ps  Fig. 2c   and then stabilized over the next 90000 ps of the simulation. The steady  Rg was observed  Fig. 2c  was indicative of a stably folded protein  61 .  3.2. Validation of docking  The capability of AutoDock Vina to accurately reproduce the docking  poses and differentiate between inactive and active compounds was  evaluated. The redocked GSH and crystallographic GSH were super   imposed against each other  Fig. 3a . An RMSD of 1.993   was  computed via LigAlign  36   as a measure of the alignment between  re docked GSH and the crystallographic GSH  PDB ID  3W8S . An RMSD  value of D2.0   was deemed acceptable  62 . The computed RMSD is  redolent of AutoDock Vina  s ability to reproduce a similar pose of GSH.  Further analyses of the mechanism of binding using LigPlot  revealed  an overlap of the critical amino acid residue Ser64  between the  co crystallized and re docked complexes  Fig. 3b .  The ROC curve is used to evaluate the capability of the AutoDock  protocol to classify active from inactive compounds  63 . The AUC is a  plausible metric in evaluating the docking protocol  s potential in  Fig. 1.A transparent surface representation of the crystallographic monomeric  Na GST 3.

An AUC value of 1  indicates a perfect categorization whereas an AUC lower than 0.5  de  scribes a poor or worthless categorization between decoys and active ligands  37 .  The five inhibitors used to develop the ROC are Cibacron blue   chenodeoxycholic acid  alizarin  lithocholic acid  and ellagic acid.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100957 5basic local alignment search tool  BLAST   64  revealed Heli  gmosomoides polygyrus GST had a 54.37  sequence identity with  Na GST 3. Heligmosomoides polygyrus GST also shared similar binding  site residues  H site  with Na GST 3 including Gly13 and Ala14 at the    domain as well as Tyr95 and Phe206 at the    domain  65 . Ellagic acid   alizarin  and chenodeoxycholic acid  on the other hand  were tested  against Echinococcus granulosus  EgGST2 3  which had a 32.55   sequence identity with Na GST 3  and their respective IC50 values were  12  0.6  M  52  6  M  and 53  3  M  38 . The AUC values generated  for the five active ligands with 225 decoys screened against Na GST 3   Na GST 2  and Na GST 1 receptor were 0.731  0.709  and 0.681   respectively  Supplementary Fig. 1   indicating reasonably good  discrimination  66 67 .  3.3. Library pre filtering and docking  A total of 2500 out of 3182 compounds were obtained after pre   filtering. This was after eliminating compounds with undesirable func  tional groups  46 68 . The remaining 2500 compounds were virtually  screened against the Na GST 3 ligand binding H site composed of  essential residues Gly13  Ala14  Phe Leu65  Tyr95  Phe106  Phe206   Glu162  and Arg120  19 . The top 5  totaling 125 hits were selected  based on high binding affinity. Shortlisting the top 5  increased the  likelihood of the true positives in the final selection. All the hits that  were excluded failed to dock deeply within the binding pocket. A total of  19 compounds were chosen depending on the poses and binding en  ergies. A range of  10.8 to  9.3 kcal mol  Table 1  were obtained for  the compounds. The compound with the highest binding affinity was  vobtusine with binding energy of  10.8 kcal mol. Moreover  the bind  ing affinities of five standard inhibitors used in the generation of the  ROC curve were juxtaposed to the top 19 hits. All the known inhibitors  except Cibacron blue had lower binding affinities  relative to the 19 hits   Table 1 . However  the Cibacron blue was observed not to dock deep in  the pocket  Supplementary Fig. 2 . 3.4. Prediction of the protein ligand interactions  The binding mechanisms of the top 19 compounds were elucidated  using the hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds  which are essential for  ligand stability. The structures of the ligands as well as the different  functional groups and key active site residues are essential for the  protein ligand complexes  69 . The number bonds and lengths formed  with the experimentally determined residues were obtained  Table 2 .  Thirteen compounds formed intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the  residues  and the strong bonds are those with short lengths  70 . The  protein ligand interactions generated for Dammarane Triterpene13 and  Cibacron Blue complexes are shown in Fig. 4. Dammarane Triterpene13  formed hydrophobic contacts with Gly13  Ala14  Glu162  Phe206  and  Tyr95  and hydrogen bonding of length 3.02   with Tyr95. Cibacron had  two hydrogen bond interactions with Tyr8 at length 2.86   and Arg12 at  3.13    and eight hydrophobic bonds with Tyr8  Phe9  Gly13  Ala14   Phe65  Tyr95  Glu162  and Phe206. The shortest bond length of 2.46    was between 3  O beta D glucocalotropin and Tyr95  Table 2 .  ZINC85999636 with a binding energy of  9.3 kcal mol had two  hydrogen bonds with Gly13 and Tyr95 at lengths 3.03   and 2.27     respectively. It also formed hydrophobic interactions comprising Gly13   Ala14  Ser64  Phe65  Phe206  and Tyr95. Other ligands namely  ZINC34518176 and ZINC14825190 were stabilized by hydrophobic  interactions with Gly13  Ala14  Tyr95  and Glu162. Moreover  4 O    4   O galloyl alpha  L rhamnopyranosyl  ellagic acid with a binding af  finity of  9.4 kcal mol had the highest number of five hydrogen bonds.  This compound formed one hydrogen bond separately with each of  Leu51  Tyr8  and Arg12  as well as two hydrogen bonds with Gln50   Table 2 . Overall  the hits formed intermolecular hydrogen and hy  drophobic bonds with most of the experimentally reported residues in  the H site including Phe Leu65  Phe106  Phe206  Glu162  and Arg120   with Gly13  Ala14 and Tyr95 considered critical  19 . Residues namely  Phe9  Ser64  Gln50 and Leu51 which formed interactions with the  crystallographic GSH were found to interact with some of the 19 hits   Table 2 . However  Lys43  Gln50  Gln63 and Pro52 did not interact  with any of the 19 hits.  3.5. Exploring the hits for anthelmintic related biological activities  The top 19 hits were further assessed for their anthelmintic related  biological activity via PASS  49   which employs Bayesian models for  biological activity prediction of a compound. The training set for PASS  Bayesian model was built on the known biological activities of over 26   000 compounds  49 . PASS compares the chemical structure of the  queried with those in the database to predict their biological activity.  Anthelmintics are a broad stream of both synthetic and natural based  products used to treat helminth infections  71 . PASS was employed  in previous studies  72 73   and the anthelmintic activity was experi   mentally corroborated  reinforcing the use of PASS for predicting the  anthelmintic tendency of compounds. A total of 9 out of 19 hits were  predicted to have anthelmintic activity with probability of activity  Pa   Fprobability of inactivity  Pi   Supplementary Table 1 . Therefore  it is  expedient to test the compounds via in vitro assaying to corroborate the  pharmacology of the compounds  74 .  ZINC85999636 was predicted to have Pa and Pi of 0.540 and 0.005   respectively  Supplementary Table 1 . Moreover  structural similarity  searches via DrugBank  50  and literature sources were employed to  support the predictions. DrugBank search revealed that ZINC85999636  had a structural similarity of 0.573 to Hesperidin. Hesperidin has a wide  range of pharmacological effects  including anthelmintic biological ac  tivity. It was reported to be effective in the inhibition of important  Schistosoma mansoni enzymes  75 .  ZINC14825190 had Pa of 0.486 and Pi of 0.025  Supplementary  Table 1   and structural analysis revealed it contains a chromen 6 one  substructure. A structural similarity search using DrugBank retrieved  genistein with a score of 0.625.

Resistance to an  thelmintics can be caused by the concentration of the drug at the target  site being altered by a Pgp mediated interaction. This mechanism has  been demonstrated in human cells  92 . Out of the twenty hits consid   ered  only two compounds namely vobtusine and 3  O beta D glucoca   lotropin were predicted as P gp substrates  Supplementary Table 2 .  The Cytochrome P450 3A4  CYP3A4  is a major drug metabolizing  enzyme  93 . CYP3A4 inhibition may lead to pharmacokinetics related  drug drug interactions and alter the response of some drugs  93 . Two  hits namely ZINC00134782 and ZINC85999636 were predicted to be  CYP3A4 inhibitors  Supplementary Table 2 . SwissADME utilizes a  support vector machine algorithm  SVM  to predict the pharmacological  profiles  51 .

Both Dammarane triterpene13 and ZINC85999636 formed  11 hydrophobic contacts  Table 2 . ZINC35418176 and ZINC14825190  separately formed nine hydrophobic contacts with the critical binding  site residues Gly13  Ala14  and Tyr95  which are reported to play major  roles in ligand binding  19 . Furthermore  all four compounds had  related anthelmintic activity. ZINC85999636 was predicted to have the  highest probable anthelmintic activity of 0.540. It is structurally similar  to Hesperidin  which is known to have anthelmintic properties  96 .  ZINC14825190 had a structural similarity of 0.625 to genistein. From  the aforementioned  genistein is an efficacious anthelmintic with  wide ranging anthelmintic activity against helminths Fasciola hepatica   Fasciolopsis busk  78   and Raillietina echinobothrida  79 . Additionally   ZINC35418176 which is structurally similar to terpine 4 ol with a score  of 0.71  had significant anthelmintic activities against helminth Hae  monchus contortus  87 . Dammarane Triterpene13 was predicted to  possess anthelminthic activity. Other hit compounds such as Olibanu   mol and ZINC95486223 had a good druglike outlook including low  binding energy  good pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties.  However  Olibanumol and ZINC95486223 may be unique scaffolds. 3.9. Screening of selected compounds against Na GST 2 and Na GST 1  The four selected compounds and the five known helminth GST  compounds were screened against the Na GST 1 and Na GST 2. This was  done to probe into the individual binding affinity of the selected com  pounds against other Na GSTs  which also perform the heme detoxifi   cation function as Na GST 3  19 20 22 . The protein ligand interaction  analysis via LigPlot was performed to establish the possibility of a  similar mechanism of binding among the selected compounds.  Na GST 1 and Na GST 2 are homologues of Na GST 3 with sequence  identities of 59.2  and 75.7  to Na GST 3  respectively  19 . Also  they  share a number of hydrophobic residues in the ligand binding site   H site . The  3 domain contains Gly13  Ala Leu14 and Leu Phe65   whilst the     domain contains Tyr95  Phe Tyr106 and Phe206 at  20 .  The docking results showed that Dammarane triterpene13   ZINC14825190  and ZINC85999636 had appreciably high binding af  finities against all the three Na GSTs  with ZINC14825190 having the  highest binding affinity of  10.8 kcal mol against Na GST 2  Table 5 .  Amongst the standard inhibitors used  Cibacron blue had a relatively  high binding affinity of  9.0 kcal mol for Na GST 1 and  9.4 kcal mol  for Na GST 2. All compounds had high binding affinities except  ZINC35418176 which had relatively low affinities of  6.1 kcal mol for  Na GST 1 and  6.6 kcal mol for Na GST 2  Table 5 .  Additionally  profiling of protein ligand interactions showed similar  interacting residues including critical residues Tyr95  Ala Ile14  and  Ile Arg99  Figs. 4a and 6  among the three receptors. This finding  corroborated the Na GSTs ligand binding mechanism similarities re  ported elsewhere  19 .  3.10. Molecular dynamics simulations of complexes  3.10.1.

Despite the spike  it had similar fluctuations as the protein core with an  RMSD closer to it. On the other hand  the Na GST 3 ZINC85999636  complex fluctuated between 0.4 nm and 0.45 nm  and the Na GST 3    ZINC35418176 complex attained stability after approximately 75 ns   even though  it had an extreme deviation from the unbound protein.  Fluctuations began to stabilize between 0.4 nm and 0.45 nm. The  Na GST 3 Cibacron blue complex also rose from 0 nm but deviated from  the fluctuations of the protein core. It stabilized between 0.3 nm and 0.4  nm  indicating not much change from the initial protein backbone co  ordinates relative to the other three complexes.  The root mean square fluctuation  RMSF  was also used as a metric  to evaluate the flexibility of the protein residues  99 100 . The fluctu   ations of the individual residues contributing to the protein ligand  complex over the 100 ns simulation were analyzed. All five complexes  including Cibacron blue possessed similar fluctuations as the protein  core with little deviations. High fluctuation levels were observed at  residue positions 30 50 and 100 125  Fig. 7b .  Finally  the protein compactness was evaluated using the radius of  gyration  Rg   101 . A stably folded complex would maintain a steady  radius of gyration. All the four lead complexes deviated from the un  bound protein by at least 0.05 nm  Fig. 7c . Dammarane triterpene13  complex stabilized around 1.65 nm  ZINC35418176 complex had fluc  tuations which also stabilized at 1.65 nm but only after the 60000th ps  and ZINC85999636 stabilized between 1.65 nm and 1.655 nm. These  observations revealed that the structures of Dammarane triterpene13  and ZINC85999636 complexes were compact after simulation. Cibacron  blue  on the other hand  deviated much from the protein core with its  fluctuations stabilizing between 1.8 nm and 1.85 nm.  3.10.2. Binding mode analysis  The protein ligand interactions of the five complexes were mapped  post molecular dynamics simulation. A superposition of the pre MD and  post MD binding modes revealed common interacting residues namely  Gly13  Ala14  Ile99 and Phe206 for ZINC14825190  Supplementary  Fig. 3 . Residues comprising Gly13  Ala14  Ile99  Arg103  Leu106  Glu  162  and Cys163 interacted with both binding modes of ZINC35418176.  Additionally  dammarane triterpene13 interacted with Ile99  Glu16   Tyr159  Ile17  Ala14  Tyr159  Leu106 and Phe206. Overall  Gly13 and  Ala14 were shown to interact with all the complexes after analyzing  their pre  and post MD binding poses.  3.10.3. Estimation of the free binding energy using the MM PBSA method  The MM PBSA was employed to estimate the binding free energies of  the complexes  102   which addresses the flaws of existing scoring  functions including the handling of solvent effects  97  and numerous  approximations in the scoring functions  103 . The MM PBSA method  estimates the van der Waals  polar solvation  non polar solvation  and  electrostatic energies  contributing jointly to the free binding energies.  The average binding energy was calculated for all five compounds. The  average binding free energy of Dammarane Triterpene13 was  194.34  kJ mol  Table 6  and it dropped steeply from  150 kJ mol to  220  kJ mol over the first 30 ns. It then appeared to be undulating over the  next 70 ns  with a nadir of around  230 kJ mol at 60 ns  Fig. 8 . Also   the free binding energy of ZINC85999636 averaged at  187.99 kJ mol   Table 6   with an initial value of  176.843 kJ mol  Supplementary Fig. 4a . The plot peaked at 35 ns with energy of 48.129 kJ mol and then  undulated after the next 10 ns. At the end of the 100 ns  29.894 kJ mol  was obtained as the final binding free energy. The average energy of  ZINC14825190 was  209.585 kJ mol  with  215.326 kJ mol as the  initial energy. It further undulated and peaked at 85 ns  Supplementary  Fig. 4b . The average binding free energy of ZINC35418176 was   181.23 kJ mol  Table 6 . At 20 ns  a peak binding energy obtained was  30.452 kJ mol  Supplementary Fig. 4c . Cibacron blue had low binding  energy initially  D0 kJ mol  during the first 40 ns but increased over the  next 60 ns  Supplementary Fig. 4d . In all instances  electrostatic  van  der Waals  and non polar solvation energies contributed favorably to the  binding energies of all the complexes  Table 6 . However  the polar  solvation energy  104   contributed adversely to the total binding en  ergy. Polar solvation energy was prominent in Cibacron blue  Table 6 .  This might have contributed to the relatively high binding energy   5.9  kJ mol .  The decomposed energy of each residue was determined. For the four  potential leads  the binding contribution of an individual residue ranged  from 4.7 kJ mol to  11.0 kJ mol  with a number of residues  Table 6  The average energy terms for the complexes with standard deviations in kJ mol.

However   the energy contribution plot of Cibacron blue ranged from 55 kJ mol to   55 kJ mol  Supplementary Fig. 5d . Critical residue Gly13 contributed   1.2083 kJ mol   2.7643 kJ mol   2.0865 kJ mol   2.3343 kJ mol  and  3.05999 kJ mol to the binding of Dammarane Triterpene13   ZINC85999636  ZINC35418176  Cibacron Blue and ZINC14825190   respectively  Table 7 . Ala14 contributed  2.5027 kJ mol   4.5778 kJ   mol   3.2030 kJ mol   0.4831 kJ mol and  4.4520 kJ mol to the  binding of Dammarane Triterpene13  ZINC85999636  ZINC35418176   Cibacron Blue and ZINC14825190  respectively  Table 7 . Tyr95  contributed  4.2508 kJ mol   2.4909 kJ mol   3.5749 kJ mol    2.2440 kJ mol  and  0.3982 kJ mol to the binding of Dammarane  Triterpene13  ZINC85999636  ZINC35418176  Cibacron Blue and  ZINC14825190  respectively  Table 7 . Residues Met110 and Cys163  also contributed favorably energies to the binding  Table 7 . Therefore   residues Met110 and Cys163 are suggested as critical amino acids for  binding.  3.11. Quality assessment of selected leads  When selecting leads for optimization in fragment based drug design   FBDD   a library of lower molecular weight molecules fragments is  screened against a target to identify the low affinity pharmacophoric  elements or potent drug leads needed for high affinity binding  105 .  FBDD aids in the development of useful drug leads with enhanced bio  logical activity  106 .  The ligand efficiency  LE  is a plausible metric used in evaluating  fragments  106 . LE measures in vitro biological activity which pertains  to the binding affinity of leads or hits binding to a receptor  based on  structural features  55 . The LE of lead like molecules is at least 0.3  kcal mol HA  107 . The selected leads had LE ranging from 0.3097 to  0.475 with ZINC35418176 having the highest LE of 0.475  Table 8 .  Though LE is a useful metric  it fails to account for the different  molecular sizes of non hydrogen atoms  hence  values obtained are not  consistent  108 . Therefore  ligands with higher molecular sizes have  relatively lower LE than smaller ones. The fit quality  FQ  and ligand  efficiency scale  LE Scale  have been proposed as better alternatives and  size independent functions  108 109 . FQ values closer to 1 suggest an  ideal binding between the ligands and the receptor  55 56 . All four  molecules had FQ values close to 1  Table 8   which suggests an ideal  binding to the receptor. Moreover  the LE Scale of 0.3 or less shows the  potential of the molecule  56 . However  all compounds were close to  the 0.3 threshold for LE Scale except ZINC35418176  Table 8  which  had 0.45502.  The Ligand efficiency dependent lipophilicity  LELP  combines both  molecular size and lipophilicity into a single efficiency  addressing  shortcomings of other metrics  55 110 . An acceptable range of  10 D LELP D10 is defined for lead like compounds with  3 DlogP D3  111 .  Additionally  compounds in the Lipinski  s zone should have a LELP  value less than 16.5  111 . ZINC35418176 and ZINC14825190 had  LELP values that are very close to the threshold for Lipinski  s zone  compounds  Table 8 . Dammarane Triterpene13 and ZINC85999636  had relatively higher LLP.  Considering these quality assessment metrics  the selected molecules  can form essential backbones for the design of novel anthelmintics. 3.12. Significance  limitations  and implications of the work  Due to the limited availability of new anthelmintics and the wide  spread resistance to them  the use of anthelmintics has become more  complex. Although  there are various strategies to fight against hel  minths  the current strategy of treating anthelmintics has challenges.  Computational techniques have evolved as a faster and more cost   effective method of finding novel anthelmintic compounds. Even  though widely used molecular docking techniques such as AutoDock  Vina have shortfalls  robust techniques are used to evaluate their per  formance to ameliorate the limitations. Several benchmark projects  have successfully evaluated their performance  112 113  and herein  used AUCs computed from the ROCs. Binding free energies computed  from MM PBSA analysis were used to support the binding affinity of the  ligands. Also  the co crystallized and re docked ligands were aligned to  regenerate the pose as a form of evaluating the molecular docking. The  outputs of the validations show that the results of the molecular docking  are reasonably acceptable albeit the deficiencies due to sensitivity and  specificity. The work further integrates different robust techniques  including characterization of binding  prediction of biological activity  and mechanisms  structural similarity evaluation  pharmacological  profiling  and MD simulations to aid in selecting plausible potential  leads. Besides  metrics such as LE  LELP  FQ and LE Scale were  computed to evaluate the efficiency of the ligands. Since the bioactivity  of the potential leads was predicted  it needs experimental confirmation.  Nevertheless  the predicted results are rich sources of data to support the  ongoing search for future hookworm therapeutic molecules. Such an  approach prioritizes few molecules for experimentation from large  ligand libraries since large scale in vitro screening of compounds is  expensive and laborious.  Computational techniques augment the drug discovery processes for  the early identification of potential leads with druglike and good phar  macological profiles. This work provided novel insights into the binding  mechanisms of Na GSTs and known inhibitors as well as the potential  leads  which could lead to the design of novel structures with the po  tential to possess Na GST 3 activity. The predicted activity provides  insights into possible inhibition of the receptor by the compounds. Also   in silico techniques have been used to elucidate the binding mechanisms  of anthelmintics  114 .  In silico inferences do not replace experimental results but rather  complements them. In the search for COVID 19 drugs  a library of about  1.3 billion compounds was screened against a key receptor of the  causative virus SARS CoV 2. This work freely made available prioritized  compounds for biotherapeutic evaluation  115 . Similarly  potential  anti SARS CoV 2  116  and anti Ebola VP24  117  compounds were  predicted from a library of African natural products.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100957 13Even though  the publication of experimentally evaluated bioactivity  is the most preferable  predicted molecules are potential basis for the  design of new inhibitors. In silico techniques provide essential molecules  which serve as baseline structures worthy of experimental exploration.  Analogues or derivatives of the predicted compounds can be explored  using techniques including pharmacophore modeling. If the predicted  compounds are not purchasable  it offers the opportunity to synthesize.  Also  compounds predicted from the robust and integrated computa   tional study are useful to the drug discovery community since they can  be tested in vitro and in vivo.  4.Conclusion  This study enriches current efforts in the development of novel an  thelmintics by leveraging African natural products as potential in  hibitors against Na GST 3. A compendium of 3182 compounds was  initially filtered to remove compounds with undesirable functional  groups. The pre filtered African natural product compounds numbering  2500 in addition to five helminth GST inhibitors were virtually screened  against the minimized Na GST 3 ligand binding H site. A total of 19 had  reasonably good binding affinity and good docking poses in the binding  pockets. The compounds formed intermolecular bonds with the known  active site residues. The four identified potential leads ZINC85999636   Dammarane triterpene13  ZINC14825190 and ZINC35418176 were  predicted to have anthelmintic biological activity. Moreover  the mol  ecules showed good pharmacological profiles  had low free binding  energies via MM PBSA analysis and had good intermolecular in  teractions with the Na GST 3 therapeutic target. The four molecules also  had high binding affinity against other Na GSTs. Ligand quality assess   ment showed the compounds to be meaningful templates for fragment  optimization. The current study is computational which warrants  further experimental evaluation to corroborate the predicted potential  inhibitory activity of the molecules  including heme regulation mecha   nisms. The study complements the development of helminth GST in  hibitors and the structures could be optimized as future therapeutic  molecules.
