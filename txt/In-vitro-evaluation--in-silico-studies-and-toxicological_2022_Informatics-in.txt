Natural and  synthetic xanthones have shown diverse biological and pharmacological properties. Thus  the present study was  designed to examine the antileishmanial activity of five xanthone analogues  their cytotoxicity assay  and in  silico studies to predict their physicochemical properties  ADME profile  and QSAR. Among these compounds  3   6 bis  4 bromobutoxy  9H xanthen 9one  XN 1  has shown the highest inhibitory effect with IC50 value 0.075   1.88  g ml. Moreover  the pharmacokinetics prediction revealed its good solubility and oral bioavailability. The  quantitative structure property relationships  QSPR  were also studied which depicted the electronic parameter   EHOMO   the physical chemistry parameter that influences CLTOT. Furthermore  the assessment of cytotoxicity  demonstrated that XN 1 exhibited the lowest cytotoxicity against brine shrimp  so it is considered the safest  xanthone analogue with LD50 115.204  103 g ml. Moreover  molecular docking was performed to investigate  the molecular mechanism of action of the synthesized compounds which were found to have good binding af  finities with different enzymes of leishmania that are involved in its essential pathways. These findings suggest  that xanthones compounds can be a promising  and effective class of products for the treatment of visceral  leishmaniasis.    1.Introduction  Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites that belong  to the genus Leishmania  1 . It is a poverty related disease  2 4   that  affects the poorest of the poor  5 7   mainly in developing countries   with several different forms  of which the two visceral leishmaniasis   VL  and cutaneous leishmaniasis  CL  are the most common  2 8 9 .  VL  the most common type of Leishmania prevalent in Sudan  is  transmitted by the bite of infected Leishmania donovani phlebotomine  sand fly female. The parasite exists in two morphological forms  the  amastigoate form  infectious stage  and the promastigote form  sand fly  stage . The disease is also caused by Leishmania donovani complex in  East Africa and Indian subcontinent and by Leishmania infantum in  many parts of the world including Latin America and Mediterranean  Basin  10 12 .  Drugs currently available for leishmaniasis treatment often show  parasite resistance  highly toxic side effect and prohibitive cost that  incompatible with patients from the tropical endemic countries. Therefore there is an urgent need for design of new candidates as  treatment solution for better health.  Xanthones   structures are related to those of flavonoids  and have  been found naturally in only eight families  namely in the Gentianaceae   Guttiferae  Polygalaceae  Leguminosae  Lythraceae  Moraceae  Loga  niaceae  and Rhamnaceae. A number of species of Hypericum genus   Guttiferae  was found containing xanthones which have been reported  to possess several biological activities  13 . Anticancer  antihyperten   sive  antioxidant  antiallergy  antithrombotic  antiviral  antibacterial   and antifungal properties are among the different biological profiles of  xanthones  depending on the substitution on the xanthone skeleton   14 17 . Xanthones have also displayed potent activity against leish  mania parasite  18 . They have also been found to inhibit a number of  therapeutically relevant enzymes  including glucosidase  19    topoisomerase II  20   aromatase  21   cyclooxygenases  kinases  DNA  polymerases  acetylcholinesterase enzyme  22  and ribonucleotide  reductase  23 .  Thus  the aim of the present study was to conduct in vitro  in silico   Corresponding author.  E mail address  shaza.shantier uofk.edu  S.W. Shantier .

Synthesis and characterisation of xanthones  All solvents and reagents used for synthesis were of general reagent  grade and were supplied by Sigma Aldrich. The completion of all re  actions was monitored by thin layer chromatography using Merck pre  coated silica plates  G F254   and petroleum ether ethyl acetate 8 2 as  the solvent system. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance  1H NMR  spectra  were recorded on a Bruker AN500 instrument. Chemical shifts were  reported in parts per million  ppm  down field from tetramethylsilane   TMS  as the internal standard. The mass spectra were run using HPLC   MS spectrophotometer. Elemental analysis was run on the Thermo Quest  CE Elemental analyzer. 3  6 Dihydroxy xanthone was prepared using  Biotage   Initiator Microwave Synthesizer.  2.1.1. Xanthones 1  2  4  A mixture of compound 1  3  6 dihydroxy 9H xanthen 9 one  0.30  g   1  4 dibromobutane or 1  4 dibromopropane  5.16 g   acetone  50  ml   and potassium carbonate  5 g  was heated with stirring for 8 hrs.  After cooling  the mixture was vacuum filtered and the resultant solid  was recrystallized from aqueous acetone  85   to a substantially pure  products XN1 and compound 2  0.58 g  90  yield . A mixture of XN1 or  compound 2  0.3 g   the corresponding amine  7.5 ml   was dissolved in  THF  10 ml   aqueous sodium hydroxide  0.2   2 ml  was added  this  mixture was stirred at 70  C for 8 h. After cooling to room temperature   the organic substance was extracted with ether  and the solvent was  evaporated under vacuum. The residual substance was dissolved in HCl   3 M  10 ml   then was shaken with ethyl acetate  30 ml   the pH of the  organic layer was raised to 10 by adding NaOH  2.5 M   and was shaken  again with ethyl acetate. The solvent was then evaporated to give the  desired compounds XN 2 and 3  respectively  Scheme 1 . 2.1.2. Xanthones 4  5  A mixture of 1  3 6 dihydroxy 9H xanthen 9 one  0.30 gm   bro  moalkane  5.16 gm   50 ml acetone  and 5 gm of potassium carbonate  was heated with stirring for 8 h. After cooling  the mixture was vacuum  filtered  solvent and the excess of bromoalkane were removed. The  resulting solid was recrystallized from aqueous acetone  85   to a  substantially pure product  XN 4 and 5   Scheme 1 .  2.2. In vitro assay for promastigote stage  2.2.1. Drugs  Amphotericin B  Ambisome R   was commercially purchased. Xan  thones stock solutions  20 mg ml  0.1  DMSO  was diluted two fold  with liver infusion treptose  LIT  complete media to obtain serial di  lutions ranging from 200  g ml to 0.049  g ml.  2.2.2. Parasite isolation and cultivation  A confirmed positive VL patient was subjected to lymph node aspi  ration for parasite isolation. Biopsies were aseptically inoculated into  vacutainers containing Novy MacNeal Nicolle  NNN  medium. Cultures  were incubated at 25  C and parasite growth was monitored daily.  Promastigotes were transferred into tissue culture flasks containing LIT  media supplemented with 10  fetal calf serum  FCS   genatmycin and  benzylpenicillin. The medium was changed every 3 days until promas   tigotes reached their stationary phase  24 26 .  2.2.3. In vitro evaluation of antileishmanial activity  Promastigote density was adjusted to 2  106 parasites ml using LIT  complete media. A volume of 100  l from parasite culture was trans   ferred into 96 well flat bottom microtiter plate. Various concentrations  of freshly prepared xanthone solutions were added  100  l  in tripli  cates. A negative control  0.1  DMSO without any drug   and positive  control  amphotericin B  were treated similarly. The plates were then  incubated at 25  C for 72 h. Parasites were counted by using hemocy   tometer  24 26 .  Scheme 1.Synthesis of xanthone analogues.  M.S.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100954 32.3. Statistical analysis of data  Each experiment was performed in triplicates. Results were  expressed as mean  standard deviation of the mean  SD  and analyzed  using SPSS 18. The IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism  6.0.  2.4. In  silico ADME properties and Lipinski  s rule of five  The SMILES series was used to simulate the ADME properties  Ab  sorption  Distribution  Metabolism  and Excretion  and Lipinski  s rule of  five of the synthesized xanthones. The pkCSM website was used to assess  these properties  27 .  2.5. Determination of QSPR  The aim of QSPR determination is to establish a quantitative rela  tionship between structure and physicochemical characteristics  28 .  The Chem3D Ultra ver.15 software tool predicted the physicochemical  properties  including lipophilic  electronic  and steric parameters.  Lipophilic parameters such as LogP and LogS are examples of lipophilic  parameters. EHOMO  and ELUMO are examples of electronic parame   ters. Molecular weight  MW  and molecular refractivity  MR  are two  steric characteristics. The online pkCSM  http   biosig.unimelb.edu.  au pkcsm prediction   was used to forecast the total clearance  CLTOT   value as a metric of drug elimination. The QSPR equation was then  calculated using Microsoft Excel spreadsheet  29 .  2.6. Cytotoxicity bioassay  2.6.1. Biological assay of brine shrimp  Six compounds  five xanthones and standard  were subjected to  Cytotoxicity evaluation following the reported procedure of the brine  shrimp lethality assay  30 .  2.6.2. Hatching of brine shrimp technique  Brine shrimp  Artemia salina leach  eggs were purchased from fish pet  shop. The eggs were then hatched in shallow plastic dish  filled with  artificial seawater prepared by dissolving 38 g of sea salt in 1 L of  distilled water. An unequal portion was made in the plastic dish with the  help of perforate device. Approximately 50 mg of eggs were sprinkled  into the large compartment that got darkened while the minor  compartment was opened to ordinary light. Two days later  nauplii   larvae were collected by a Pasteur pipette from the lighted side negative  control  31 .  2.6.3. Test procedure  The samples  triplicate  to be assayed were dissolved in DMSO  2 mg  of the pure compounds dissolved in 2 ml of solvent . For speed and  ensure dissolving  samples were sonicated  then 200  l  20  l  2  l of this  solution was transferred to vials corresponding to 4  0.4 and 0.04  g ml  respectively. The solvent was evaporated overnight. After two days of  hatching  10 Naupliil larvae were placed into each vial and the volume  was adjusted with the artificial sea water to 5 ml per vial  and incubated  at 27  C for 24 h under illumination. The number of survivors were then  counted and recorded. Reference cytotoxic drug  potassium dichromate   served as positive control. Evaluation of the test results  using the values  on died individuals in given concentrations determine the percent of mortality. The date was processed using Finney computer program  and  LD50  the concentration of test compound that cause death of larva by  50   values were obtained at 95  confidence intervals  32 .  2.7. Molecular docking  The molecular docking was performed in order to estimate the  binding affinities between the synthesized xanthones and different en  zymes of leishmania which are involved in its essential pathways.  2.7.1. Ligands preparation  All xanthones under study were sketched using Chem3D Ultra ver.15  software tool. The MMFF 94 method was used to optimize the molecule  and minimize the geometry of the ligand  and saved in pdb format ready  for docking.  2.7.2. Targets preparation  The crystal structures of the four enzymes  adenine phosphoribosyl  transferase  PDB ID  1QB7   petredine reductase  PDB ID  2XOX  and N   Myristoyltransferase  PDB ID  2WUU  were retrieved from RCSB PDB   protein data bank  database. Swiss PDB viewer V.4.1.0 software  33   was used for structure optimization. The fourth enzyme  trypanothione  reductase  was homology modelled using the BLAST feature of  SWISS MODEL server and validated using QMEAN scoring function   26 .  2.7.3. Molecular docking  Molecular docking was then performed using AutoDock 4.0 soft  ware  based on the Lamarckian genetic algorithm  which combines en  ergy evaluation through grids of affinity potential to find the suitable  binding position for a ligand on a given protein  34 35 . The results less  than 1.0A  in positional root mean square deviation  RMSD  were  considered ideal and clustered together for finding the favorable bind  ing. The highest binding energy  most negative  was considered as the  ligand with maximum binding affinity which was then visualized using  DS Visualizer Client 2020.  3.Results  3.1. Structural elucidation  The five xanthones   analogues had been successfully re synthesized   Scheme 1 . The structure of the synthesized compounds were estab   lished using NMR and MS spectral data  Supplementary file 1 . All the  peaks appeared at their expected chemical shift values with appropriate  multiplicities as singlet  s   doublet  d   triplet  t  or quartet  q . J values  were almost the same in each direction. When J value is large compared  with the chemical shift differences     the patterns distort  which usu  ally happens in aromatic rings.  3  6 bis  4 bromobutoxy  9H xanthen 9one  XN 1   1H NMR   500 MHz  CDCl3    8.29  8.22  m  2H   6.97  6.84  m  4H   4.15  t  J   6.0 Hz  4H   3.54  t  J  6.5 Hz  4H   2.16  2.02  m  8H .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100954 83.6. Molecular docking  The five xanthones were further docked with the key enzymes of the  most essential pathways for Leishmania survival. The obtained results of  interactions between xanthones and target enzymes were depicted in  Figs. 1 4 and Table 6. 4.Discussion  To help meet the critical need for safe and effective anti leishmanial  drugs  several bioactive compounds with antileishmanial activity and  diverse modes of action have been synthetized  36 42 . Herein  we are  reporting effective and safer xanthones derivatives for the inhibition of  Leishmania donovani  employing Amphotericin B as reference  compound.  Following the successful re synthesis of the five xanthones  their  antileishmanial activities were then assessed as percentage of inhibition  and 50  inhibitory concentration  IC50 . All xanthones showed signif   icant IC50 values  pair sample test  P  0.05  in the range 13.09   4.55  0.075  0.09  g ml when compared to amphotericin B whose IC50  value was 0.13  0.02  g ml  Table 1 . A functionalized alkoxy sub  stituent  at positions 3 and 6  appears to have a role in the anti  leishmanial activity displayed by these xanthones. This could be  confirmed by the highest IC50 value that associated with xanthone 5   13.09  4.55  g ml   which has a non functionalized dibutoxy sub  stituents. Xanthones 2 and 3  which have diaminobutoxy substituents   were proved to be more potent than xanthones 4 and 5 where their IC50  values were 0.22  0.025 and 0.177  0.085  g ml  respectively. The  amino functionality appears to add extra binding interaction between  xanthone 2 and 3  and their target via hydrogen bonding or ionic  interaction. The resultant high affinity of these xanthones to their target  Fig. 4.2D view of the synthesized xanthones bound to modelled trypanothione reductase.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100954 9could rationalize their increased potency in comparison to xanthone 5.  Xanthone 3 was found to be more potent than xanthone 2 revealing that  the higher potency is in favor with a spacer of three methylene units is  more suitable than that of four units. Having displayed the lowest IC50  value  0.075  0.013  g ml   xanthone 1 is believed to undergo  nucleophilic substitution reaction with its target to form an irreversible  bond between the carbon bearing the bromine atom  leaving group  and  a nucleophilic center in the target.  Pharmacokinetic and toxicological characteristics are critical com  ponents of drug design in order to obtain excellent oral bioavailability  and safe medicines. As a result  ADME computational assessments were  then conducted to evaluate these xanthone derivatives.  The physicochemical properties are calculated using the  Lipinski  s  rule of five . According to the rule  most  drug like   molecules contain  logP 5  molecular weight 500 Da  ten hydrogen bond acceptors  and five  hydrogen bond donors. Moreover  good bioavailability is more likely for  compounds with  10 rotatable bonds  nrotb  and total polar surface  area  TPSA  of  140    43 . Our findings  summarized in Table 2  re  flected that all the compounds except XN2 obeying the rule in terms of  hydrogen bonds and total polar surface area. They were also predicted to  have molecular weights less than 500 Da and subsequently easily  transported  diffuse and absorbed as compared to heavy molecules  44 .  Additionally  their ADME properties indicated that they are less likely to  have solubility problems which could lead to poor bioavailability as well  as formulation problems  45 .  Following the prediction of ADME properties  the QSPR was also  studied. The best correlation coefficient and significance of the six  regression equations were the selection criteria. The ideal regression  equation to review is as follows  46     Log1 CL TOT   0.29 EHOMO   2.96                                                         Because it has the best correlation coefficient  R  0.962   the  smallest significance of 0.008  0.05   the smallest standard error  SE   0.081   and the highest F value  37.96   it was thus chosen  Table 4 . The  electronic parameter  EHOMO   was the physical chemistry parameter that  influenced the CLTOT  according to the equation.  Following the pharmacokinetics prediction  we now turned to assess  the toxicity profile of these compounds. The brine shrimp lethality test  was applied to determine the toxicity of these compounds in final for  mulations  which was based on their capacity to kill laboratory pro  duced brine shrimp  Artemia salina  . The brine shrimp assay has been  used to identify fungal toxins  plant extract toxicity  heavy metals   pesticides  and cytotoxicity testing of dental materials  47  and syn  thetic organic compounds  48 . It is regarded a valuable technique for  early toxicity evaluation.  The procedure is appealing since it is simple  affordable  and requires  just little quantities of toxin to complete the test on a microwell scale.  During our research  the brine shrimp lethality assay has shown to be a  useful tool for tracking the biological activities of the tested xanthones.  Out of the five xanthones screened for toxicity against the brine shrimp   XN1 was found to be the safest one  115.204  103  g ml   with the rest  four varying in their LD50 values  Table 5 .  A good starting point for the identification of drug targets is to  pinpoint differences between essential metabolic pathway of the host  and parasite  which are easier identify once the parasite physiology and  host parasite relationships are better understood  49 . There are several  pathways in Leishmania  thus it is necessary to target more than one  enzyme at a time to come up with effective anti leishmanial chemo   therapy  50 .  Adeninephosphoribosyl transferase is one of the three forms of  phosphoribosyl transferase enzyme involving in purine salvage  pathway. Inhibition of these enzymes leads to depletion of purine and  thus results in parasite death. Petredine reductase is an important  enzyme in the folate biosynthesis pathway. This pathway is responsible  for DNA and RNA synthesis and amino acid metabolism. Thus  the inhibition of these enzymes will result in parasite growth inhibition. N   Myristoyltransferase is responsible for multiple cellular processes like  signal transduction  through targeting proteins to membrane locations  and mediating protein  protein interactions. It catalyzes the attachment  of the 14 carbon saturated fatty acid   myristate   to the amino terminal  glycine residue protein. Inhibition of this enzyme will result in loss of  protein structure stability. The fourth important enzyme is trypano   thione reductase. It is responsible for regulating oxidative stress and  maintaining the cellular redox potential  so its inhibition will result in  parasite death through loss of protection against oxidative stress.  Herein  we have investigated the molecular interaction between  these key enzymes of the essential pathways for leishmania survival as  potential targets and the synthesized xanthones. The obtained docking  analysis results  Figs. 1 4  Table 6  showed variable extent of bindings  between the xanthones and target enzymes. Interestingly  all the com  pounds predicted to have excellent antileishmanial activity via inhibi   tion of the key enzymes through binding with the amino acid residues  which are reported to be essential for the higher binding in the pocket of  the active sites  51 55 .  5.Conclusion  The present study suggested that all the studied xanthone derivatives  are effective against Leishmania donovani promastigote  with xanthone  1 showing the highest activity. In silico ADME properties also predicted  the profile of all xanthone compounds  as well as their physicochemical  properties. In addition  all xanthone compounds were proved to be safe  based on the obtained cytotoxicity assay. The findings emphasize that  these compounds  especially xanthone 1  can be developed as a potential  new therapy for visceral leishmaniasis.  Consent for publication  Not applicable.
