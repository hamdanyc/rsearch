In this critical situation  decreasing COVID 19 readmissions could potentially sustain hospital  capacity. This study aimed to select the most affecting features of COVID 19 readmission and compare the  capability of Machine Learning  ML  algorithms to predict COVID 19 readmission based on the selected features.  Material and methods  The data of 5791 hospitalized patients with COVID 19 were retrospectively recruited from  a hospital registry system. The LASSO feature selection algorithm was used to select the most important features  related to COVID 19 readmission. HistGradientBoosting classifier  HGB   Bagging classifier  Multi Layered Per  ceptron  MLP   Support Vector Machine   SVM  kernel  linear   SVM  kernel  RBF   and Extreme Gradient  Boosting  XGBoost  classifiers were used for prediction. We evaluated the performance of ML algorithms with a  10 fold cross validation method using six performance evaluation metrics.  Results  Out of the 42 features  14 were identified as the most relevant predictors. The XGBoost classifier out  performed the other six ML models with an average accuracy of 91.7   specificity of 91.3   the sensitivity of  91.6   F measure of 91.8   and AUC of 0.91 .  Conclusion  The experimental results prove that ML models can satisfactorily predict COVID 19 readmission.  Besides considering the risk factors prioritized in this work  categorizing cases with a high risk of reinfection can  make the patient triaging procedure and hospital resource utilization more effective.    1.Introduction  Hospital readmission is a well accepted metric of hospital care  quality  1 . It is defined as the new hospitalization in the same hospital  within a specified time between 30 and 60 days after initial hospital  discharge  2 4 . The high readmission rates are most probably related to  the quality of care delivered by hospitals and other health centers during  or after the former admission  5 6 . Because of the high costs that readmission imposes on hospitals and patients  it has gained substantial  attention as one of the most important criteria for evaluating the quality  of care and discharge procedures. Estimates show that 60  of patient  readmission can be prevented  7 8 .  As the prevalence of the COVID 19  the health care systems of many  countries were collapsed and could not meet the growing needs of pa  tients to diagnose  treatment  and care services  9 10 . Many patients in  such conditions were discharged after admission with partial recovery  Abbreviations  COVID 19  Coronavirus disease 2019  CDSS  Clinical Decision Support Systems  ML  Machine learning  CRISP  Cross Industry Standard Process   LASSO  Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator  AUC  Area under the curve  HGB  Hist Gradient Boosting  MLP  Multi Layered Perceptron  SVM  Support  Vector Machine  XGBoost  Extreme Gradient Boosting.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100908 2 11 . Meanwhile  due to the unknown and aggressive nature of the  disease  the readmission rate of patients increased  12 . Readmission  imposes additional costs on care organizations and patients. In addition   it will reduce the quality indicators of service delivery  increase the rate  of serious complications and deaths during the pandemic  13 . Ac  cording to the formal reports  about 5  of COVID 19 confirmed patients  necessitate hospitalization care services  and the tolls of readmission  from this disease report vary from 2 to 10   14 15 .  In this situation  enhancing the capability of the healthcare system  against the pandemic requires attention to technological and intelligent   based solutions such as Clinical Decision Support Systems  CDSSs   16   17 . CDSSs attracted increasing interest because of the growing avail  ability of a large amount of patient level data  18 19 . CDSSs using  available patient data at the time of admission may provide caregivers  with valuable information regarding the likelihood risk of COVID 19  readmission  20 21 . Machine learning  ML  algorithms are complex  and flexible classification modeling that leverage big datasets to reveal  new and practical patterns  18 22 . ML algorithms will reduce un  certainties and ambiguities related to new diseases such as COVID 19 by  providing diagnostic and predictive models based on valid and scientific  evidence to assess risks  screening  forecasting  and health planning  23   24 . Recently  published works have shown that several ML methods are  more accurate than conventional statistics models for predicting clinical  outcomes in COVID 19 hospitalized patients. They are such as predict   ing the Length of Stay  LOS   hospital bed occupancy and turnover   Intensive Care Unit  ICU  admission  and respiratory intubation   25 27 .  Due to the high prevalence of the disease in our country and the  existence of some limitations and lack of healthcare resources  28    therefore  the purpose of this study is to develop an effective and effi  cient diagnostic model based on comparing the performance of ML al  gorithms for COVID 19 readmission prediction. Therefore  the present  study seeks to answer two questions. What are the most important predictor variables affecting readmission and worsening of patients after  receiving first hospitalization services  And which ML model is more  effective for predicting readmission   2.Material and methods  2.1. Study roadmap and experiment environment  The present study was conducted in the form of a retrospective and  single center study in 2022 to predict readmission in patients with  confirmed COVID 19 based on one of the most popular ML methods  called the Cross Industry Standard Process  CRISP . It was carried out  through five main steps including  1  Data understanding  2  Data pre  processing  3  Feature selection  4  Classifier  and 5 Evaluation. Fig. 1  shows the proposed models of study steps and sub steps based on CRISP.  This study used Python programming language to run all experiments on  the data mining algorithms to predict readmission in patients with  confirmed COVID 19  see Fig. 2 .  2.2. Data set description  The included cases are defined based on 42 variables in three main  classes  including patient  s demographics  three variables   hospitali   zation  eight variables   and clinical  31 variables   see Table 1 . After  reviewing the demographical  clinical and hospitalization information  of the patients with confirmed COVID 19  statically analysis was per  formed to describe the differences in the patients with confirmed  COVID 19 data  were readmitted or not. For this purpose  the differences  in demographical and hospitalization information of patient were  described based on whether the patients were readmitted or not  and the  relationship of each feature with readmission was checked by the Chi   square test.  Of 5791 COVID 19 hospitalized patients  3071  53.04   were male   Fig. 1.The roadmap of the proposed system for prediction of readmission based on the CRISP method.  M.R.

Out of 5791  included patients  870  15.02   patients were readmitted within 30  days after initial discharge.  2.3. Ethical consideration  The ethical committee board approved the study of Ilam University  of Medical Sciences  Ethics code  IR.MEDILAM.REC.1399.294 . To  protect the privacy and confidentiality of patients  we concealed the  unique identification information of all patients in the process of data  collection and presentation.  2.4. Preprocessing step  Preprocessing on the dataset was applied before the training of the  proposed model. Several preprocessing steps were examined on the  dataset  including removing missing values  rows with missing values  greater than 70  were removed.   Standard scalar  Min Max Scalar   Data validation under sampling for correct use of data in the machine  learning algorithms. The noisy and abnormal values  duplicates  and  meaningless data impacted ML models   results and were examined and  removed by two authors   M  A and M  SH .  2.5. Patient selection criteria  After applying the exclusion criteria  out of 9180 confirmed COVID   19 patients  6411 hospitalized cases were included in the study. In the  preprocessing steps  818 patient record values were removed  and after  deleting these values  the number of patient records was reduced to  5791 cases. Among them  870  15.02   cases were readmitted after a  30 day of the first hospitalization. 2.6. Feature selection  Feature selection or variable selection is needed before feeding data  into the ML algorithms since outside dimensions affect the classification  performance and precision and decrease run time  29 . To select the  most important feature to predict readmission  we used Least Absolute  Shrinkage and Selection Operator Features Selection Algorithm  LASSO   in this study. The LASSO selects the most important and relevant fea  tures for predicting readmission in COVID 19 patients according to  updating the absolute value of the variables   coefficient. If the co  efficients value of variables is equal to zero  these zero Values for fea  tures eliminated that from features subset  and if any variables obtained  high values for coefficients. Hence  the feature included in selected  variables subsets.  2.6.1. Machine learning methods  In this study  to predict the readmission in the patient with confirmed  COVID 19  we used seven ML classification algorithms  including Hist  Gradient Boosting  HGB  classifier  Bagging classifier  Multi Layered  Perceptron  MLP  classifier  Support Vector Machine   SVM  kernel   linear   SVM  kernel  RBF   and Extreme Gradient Boosting  XGBoost   classifier.  2.7. Performance metrics  To evaluate the performance of applied algorithms and verify the  quality of the algorithms in this study  we used the k fold cross   validation method. Cross validation is a resampling method used to  assess ML models in an unseen data sample. This method has one  parameter named k that refers to the number of parts that the dataset  should be split. In this study  we use 10  fold cross validation method. In  10 fold cross validation methods  the algorithms are trained and tested  10 time times  and then the mean evaluation metrics.

Patient characteristics  The mean age of patients who were readmitted to the hospital was 59   9 years old. The mean age of patients who were not readmitted to the  hospital was 51  6 years old  p D0.002 . Table 1 indicated that there  was a significant association between some features of patients who  readmitted or not  features with p value D0.005 that showed in Table 1  with     symbol  have a significant difference in patients who read  mitted d or not class. For example  the results showed that there was a  significant relationship between ICU admission and COVID status with  readmission  p value D0.002  and  p value D0.001   respectively.  3.2. Feature selection  The LASSO feature selection method selects the most important and  relevant features for predicting readmission according to updating the  absolute value of the variables   coefficient. The LASSO feature selection  ranks the relevant variables. After feature selection  out of 42  28 vari  ables have not been selected to predict readmission and have been  deleted from the dataset. The top 14 selected important variables by the  LASSO feature selection method and their scores are represented in  Table 2.  Based on Table 2  COVID 19 status  ICU admission  and oxygen  therapy obtain the highest score for the prediction of readmission in a  patient with COVID 19. Moreover  age and solid metastatic tumor have  a low score in relevant variables scores  so it means that age and solid  metastatic tumor have a low impact on the prediction of readmission in  confirmed COVID 19 patients. 3.3. Results of hyper parameters tuning  The performance of ML algorithms is highly dependent on the se  lection of their hyper parameters. Hyper parameters are applied to ML  algorithms to produce the best model on a given dataset. After the  preprocessing step  several ML modeling was performed by adjusting  and optimizing hyper parameters. The best hyper parameters needed to  build models with the highest F criteria score were identified during this  step. In the present study  to select the most precise and powerful  models  the Randomized Search CV method was used for parameter  adjustment and optimization algorithms  including HGB classifier   Bagging classifier  MLP classifier  SVM  kernel  linear   SVM  kernel   RBF   and XGBoost classifier. Table 3 represents the best Hyper   parameters for ML algorithm modeling for predicting readmission.  3.4. K fold cross validation  Selected features by the LASSO feature selection method were tested  on seven ML algorithms with a 10 fold cross validation method. 10 fold  cross validation splits our selected data set into ten subsets and performs  the holdout method ten times. 90  of data was used for training ML  algorithms for each run  and 10  was fed into the algorithms to test  models. To measure the performance of ML algorithms with a 95   confidence interval  we measured the mean of evaluation metrics.  Table 4 shows the results of seven prediction models on the selected  feature by the LASSO method with a 10 fold cross validation method to  predict the readmission in COVID 19 patients.

The second important model was SVM with the linear  kernel  ACU  0.892   and the worst performance was observed for the  HGB classifier out of six other ML algorithms  AUC  0.8233 . The  classification report and ROC curve of the XGBoost classifier as the best  classification algorithm in the present study in terms of the highest  evaluation metrics are displayed in Fig. 4.  4.Discussion  Given the unknown nature of COVID 19 with a wide range of  symptoms and complications  it is important to implement intelligent   based models for estimating the possibility of its reinfection and recur   rence  30 31 . Readmission and disease recurrence prediction is com  plex and challenging  especially in new and ambiguous diseases such as  COVID 19  32 33 . Based on our knowledge  this work is one of the few  studies that applied ML algorithms for predicting the readmission risk of  patients with COVID 19.  So far  most previous ML based studies have focused on predicting  readmission of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular  1 34 39    stroke  40 44   and COPD  5 6 45 47 . Till now  few studies have been  conducted about COVID 19 readmission. In Rodriguez  s study  2021   a  predictive model for readmission in COVID 19 patients was presented  based on an ML classifier. They concluded that ML and data  mining based approaches have seemed fruitful for readmission predic   tion  20 . Koteswari  2020  proposed an intelligent model to predict the  readmission probability of various COVID 19 cases using ML techniques.  The experimental results demonstrate ML based predictive models can  reduce COVID 19 readmission  30 . Raftarai  2021  compared the  performance of four ML algorithms for predicting readmission in pa  tients with COVID 19. The AdaBoost ensemble classifier yielded the best  performance  accuracy 91.61    33 . Similarly  Jia  2021  assessed the  performance of some ML algorithms to predict future deterioration Table 3  Best hyper parameters for ML algorithm modeling in prediction of readmission.

Finally  the best perfor   mance was yielded by XGBoost with a mean accuracy of 91.7   mean  specificity of 91.3   mean sensitivity of 91.6   mean F measure of  91.8   and AUC of 91.45 . Ryu  2021   48  showed Gradient Boosting  Machine  GBM  and Lo  2021   49  concluded Categorical boosting   Catboost  had the highest AUC performance    75.1 and  75.15  respectively  in prediction readmission. Besides in recent studies  per  formed in 2021  by Zhao  50   Darabi  51   Chen  52   Shah  53   the  results showed Boosting algorithms gained better performance in pre  dicting patient readmission.  Boosting like Adaptive Boosting  Ada Boost   XGBoost  HGB  Cat  boost and GBM is a set of powerful and most widely used ML algorithms.  Boosting classifiers improve the classification accuracy by combining of  the outputs from a sequence of weak learner and developing a robust  predictive model  54 55 . The results of previous studies showed that  the performance of these algorithms was optimum in predicting hospital  readmission risk in patients with COVID 19. In the present study  due to  the optimization of prediction variables through performing feature  selection and data preprocessing before using them as inputs for  modeling  the performance of the implemented models has been  improved. Similarly in the current work the XGBoost model out  performed the other six techniques  0.91  AUC  0.91  0.92 CI and  0.0146 STD .  Since the COVID 19 pandemic began  several studies selected clinically important predictors for post discharge COVID 19. For  example  Rodriguez  s study  2021  indicated underline chronic disease   hypoxia  oxygen saturation  94    increased LDH  CRP  and ESR as the  most effective factors on hospital readmission  20 . In another study  performed by Mendito  2021   several clinical features such as age   neutrophilia count  sequential organ failure assessment  SOFA   LDH   CRP  and D dimer are recognized as highly contributing factors to the  readmission of COVID 19 patients  31 . But  Duarte  s research  2021   detected polypharmacy  living in residential care or nursing homes   general illness  chest pain  psychological symptoms  syncope  and su  perinfection as the most relevant factors on COVID 19 hospital read  mission  56 . Accordingly  in Nematshahi et al. s  2021  study  the  period between discharge to readmission  age  gender  underline dis  ease  creatinine level  and pulmonary involvement were renowned as  influencing factors in predicting COVID 19 readmission  57 .  Similarly  in Jeon  s  2020  research  age and sex variables and the  presence of underlying disease are effective in increasing the risk of  readmission of COVID 19 patients  58 . The presence of comorbidities   high BMI  adult age  laboratory indicators such as CRP  creatinine  and  ALT ASP rate was introduced as one of the most important underlying  factors for readmission in COVID 19 patients in the Verna study  59 . In  a systematic review study conducted by Akbari et al.  2021   they  concluded that male sex  white ethnicity  comorbid diseases  and old age  are affecting variables on COVID 19 readmission  60 .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100908 8study  2021  also showed that certain comorbidities such as diabetes   hypertension  and cardiovascular diseases have a higher capability in  predicting the readmission risk among COVID 19 patients  61 . Age  over 60 years  underlying diseases  especially diabetes  high creatinine  level  and lung involvement were the essential predictors of readmission  in the patients with COVID 19  et al.  32  . The most important vari  ables in the Green  2021  study for readmission prediction were age   LOS  ICU admission  oxygen saturation  D dimer  and cardiovascular  diseases  62 .  Similarly  we identified 14 highly correlated variables with the  output class. Major risk factors for readmission in the current study  include COVID 19 status  ICU admission  Oxygen therapy  CRP on  admission  duration of hospitalization  Solid organ transplantation   Lymphocytes on discharge  Coronary artery disease  Cerebrovascular  disease  CRP on admission  congestive heart failure  asthma  metastatic  solid tumor  and age most of which are non modifiable.  It should be noted that the identified variables in the present study  are consistent with the previous researches. In the reviewed studies   baseline variables  e.g. age and sex   laboratory indicators  underlying  diseases  comorbidities  and resource utilization variables such as LOS   ICU admission  and oxygen therapy play a pivotal role in predicting the  readmission of patients with COVID 19. However in these studies  the  importance of radiological data for readmission risk prediction among  COVID 19 patients  has been neglected. Similarity  in the present study   after doing feature selection  the selected data set lacks radiological  variables. Therefore  more studies are needed in this regard.  In addition  several models for predicting the risk of readmission  among COVID 19 patients have been developed  one of which gained  reasonable performance in the evaluation phase. Interestingly  the  selected ML algorithm  XGBoost  can predict the 30 day readmission  risk of patients with high accuracy. The proposed model of the present  study can help healthcare providers timely detect patient deterioration  and reduce the severe complications and the resulting mortalities. This  study is a retrospective single center study including a relatively small  number of patient data. Therefore  the findings may not be generalizable  to the wider population. In addition  the existence of some noisy data  fields such as inconsistency  meaningless  missing  error prone  and  abnormal fields might impact the data mining accuracy.  Moreover  we used only eight ML algorithms for prediction analyses  based on some clinical features. Our data set furthermore lacked clini  cally essential variables such as imaging indicators. Therefore  at first  to  remove noisy data  the normal range of each variable is defined using  the opinion of two infectious diseases specialists. Then  we specified all  the values outside the defined range and completed them by referring  them to the responsible doctor. In addition  the records with more than  70  of empty fields   439 as shown in Fig. 1  were removed. The  missing fields in the records with less than 70  missing are imputed by  mean and mode values substitution for continuous and discrete vari  ables  respectively. Additional external validation methods should be  used to prove the results of the present study and further verify the  generalizability of our results. Finally  the selected dataset lacks some  clinical variables such as radiological indicators. As practical solutions   the accuracy and generalizability of our models will be enhanced if we  test more ML techniques at the larger  multicenter  and prospective  datasets.  5.Conclusion  We implement and validate several predictive models stratifying  readmission risk for COVID 19 patients. In particular  it has been  observed that the XGBoost model performed best on classification ac  curacy better than the other ML algorithms. This method can provide  caregivers and hospital administrators with an effective instrument to  allocate limited hospital resources best. These models also may be an  advantage in better and customized care delivery  lessen clinician  workload  and diminish severe complication and death in the COVID 19 patients. In future work  the proposed method is expected to be applied  to other hospital resource utilization domains such as ICU bed turnover   LOS  and respiratory ventilator.
