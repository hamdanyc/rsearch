An outbreak of the disease may lead to entire mortality within a  short period under standard culture conditions. The sequencing and characterization of several MABV strains  have begun to reveal information regarding pathogen biology and pathogenicity. The major capsid protein VP2  and RNA dependent RNA polymerase  RdRp   as well as polyprotein of Lates calcarifer birnavirus  was deter   mined from several marine birnavirus  MABV  strains from different host or geographic origins. Despite the  devastating complications  there is very limited prevention or control for the virus. In this regard  an immu   noinformatics method was used to generate an epitope based vaccine against this pathogen. The immunodo   minant T cell epitopes were identified using the most antigenic and pathogenic proteins of MABV. The final  constructed vaccine sequence was developed to be immunogenic  non allergenic as well as to have better sol  ubility. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed significant binding stability and structural compactness. Finally   using Escherichia coli K12 as a model  codon optimization yielded ideal GC content and a higher CAI value  which  was then included in the cloning vector pET2  a . Overall  our findings suggest that the suggested peptide  vaccine might be a viable approach for MABV prevention.    1.Introduction  Marine birnavirus  MABV  is a species of the family Birnaviridae   genus Aquabirnavirus  which possesses a genome consisting of two  segments of double stranded RNA in an icosahedral encapsulated ribo  nucleic acid  1 . MABV is very similar to IPNV  Infectious pancreatic  necrosis virus   even though it is possible to differentiate them by their  nucleotide sequence in the VP2 NS region. This sequence is located  between the major capsid protein VP2 and the viral protease NS in the  large segment  2 . It has been isolated from epizootics in yellowtail   Seriola quinqueradiata   and Asian Seabass  Lates calcarifer   from the  coastal fish farms in Singapore  3 4 . MABV  on the other hand  is  thought to infect a range of marine fish  including Japanese flounder   red sea bream  Pagrus major tiger puffer  amberjack  and others.  MABV can infect a variety of fish species without causing any symptoms and with low viral titers in affected fish  5 . This shows that  MABV infection causes the host fish to enter a reservoir condition  1 .  Symptoms of this disease include a darkening of the skin  a distended  abdomen  and a spiraling motion. RNA dependent RNA polymerase   RdRp  is an essential protein for the replication of MABV as well as all  RNA viruses  6 . A high degree of homology exists between the active  domain of RdRp and viruses belonging to different species  genera  and  even families. In addition  among the two segments  segment A of the  birnavirus genome encodes a polyprotein and a small protein  6 . The  polyprotein is co translationally processed and cleaved at the major  capsid protein VP2 NS associated protease activity and essentially  MABV requires the introduction of such VP2 NS polymerase complex  into the host cell to initiate the viral replication cycle  6 . Moreover  the  MABV adsorbs not just susceptible cells but also resistant ones  7 . The  virus reached the cytoplasm via the endocytotic route but did not reach   Corresponding author.

Ineffective  attachment advancement can lead to this viral replication failure if this  interaction is hampered. In this regard  the present study aims to use  in silico approaches to develop an epitope based vaccine targeting virus  envelope proteins VP2  polyprotein  and RdRp of MABV.  It is particularly challenging to deal with viral pathogens  whether  they have been around for decades or whether they have recently re   emerged as diseases  since there are few  if any  effective treatments   and effective viral vaccines as a means of delivery in aquatic environ   ments remain elusive  8 . The expansion of aquaculture operations  across the world has created new chances for the spread of aquatic vi  ruses  and the presence of viral infections remains a critical limiting  factor for aquaculture productivity and the natural environment  s  biodiversity  9 . Farming practices enhance disease transmission   re emergence of diseases  and on farm conditions may limit their ca  pacity to battle infection  8 . Aquabirnavirus  family Birnaviridae  is the  largest and most diverse virus genera for marine and freshwater fish  species  10 . In 1983 a pathogenic MABV is yellowtail ascites virus   which was the first aquabirnavirus isolated from yellow tail in Japan   11 . Since then MABV have been detected in various marine hosts  1 .  Recently this virus was detected from Asian sea bass in Singapore  declaring re emergence of the MABV in south Asian region  3 . Research  showed that a set of novel gene is responsible for the disease and sci  entists predict that the coastal fish farming technique might be a cause of  the disease re occurrence in the farming level. However  researchers  came to the conclusion that further disease transmission investigations  and better monitoring systems are needed to fully comprehend the  pathogenicity and epidemiology of this new MABV  3 .  In addition  the prompt discovery of safe  efficient  uncomplicated   economical  dependable immune responses to the directed antigen  emerges quickly and is made possible by the in silico design of multi   epitope vaccines against viruses. Epitope based vaccines have been  successfully created in the postgenomic period to stimulate respon   siveness against some of the worst human viruses  including influenza   Nipah  zika  ebola  MARS CoV  rota  and others  12 16 . Lately  an  in silico technique was effective in predicting epitopes and multi   epitopes with significant responsiveness against Streptococcus agalactiae    Edwardsiella tarda   and Flavobacterium columnarie separately  17 19 .  Experts expect that in the coming days  computer assisted techniques  will be increasingly successful in controlling fish diseases  20 21 . As a  result  the main objective of this research was to identify epitopes from  the best antigenic proteins to fight infection from MAVB. As a part of this  study  in silico cloning of the vaccine construct was also introduced   which might facilitate the easy wet lab synthesis of the vaccine and  further testing on animal models in the future.  2.Methods and materials  2.1. Proteome selection from database and antigenicity prediction  Marine birnavirus  MABV  proteomic data screening was conducted  using ViPR  22  and NCBI Genbank databases. We used the NCBI  database to retrieve the Polyprotein  Accession No. YP 010086267.1    RNA dependent RNA polymerase  Accession No. YP 010086266.1   and  Major capsid protein VP2  Accession No. AAQ82705.1  for antigen se  lection. We examined all the three selected proteins for epitope based  subunit vaccine design because of their direct role in pathogenesis. All  the chosen protein sequences were obtained as FASTA files. VaxiJen  v2.0 server was used to assess the protective antigens  23  and for each  of them  a threshold value of 0.4 was chosen. Moreover  we predicted  the subcellular location of the viruses by VirusPloc server  24  and for  the transmembrane helices prediction  TMHMM 2.0 was used  25 .  VirusPloc predicts the subcellular localization of viral proteins within  the host and virus infected cells which is very important for any kind of  drug target or vaccine design. On the other hand  The TMHMM 2.0 server is a hidden Markov model based technique for predicting mem  brane protein topology. It accurately predicts transmembrane helices  and distinguishes between soluble and membrane proteins.  2.2. Epitope prediction and evaluation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes  CTLs   CTLs are one of several types of immune system cells that can directly  destroy other infectious cells  26 . They immediately enter the viral cell  and contribute to the host s defensive response. The sequence of the  chosen protein was entered into the CTLPred  http   crdd.osdd.net ra  ghava ctlpred    server to predict CTLs epitope  27 . Artificial neural  network  ANN  and stabilized matrix method implementation  SMM   were used to predict the peptide binding ability to MHC molecules.  Epitopes were predicted based on previously reported alleles in verte   brates. The predicted epitopes were further assessed through the Vax  iJen v2.0  23   MHC class I immunogenicity  28   ToxinPred  29   and  AllerTop v2.0  30  servers. All of the forecasts were made using the  default parameters of each server.  2.3. Vaccine engineering and development  The vaccine was created by combining the chosen CTL epitopes with  a suitable adjuvant and linking them with the proper linkers  31 32 .  Since viral glycoproteins recognize TLR3  and adjuvants are essential for  overcoming the constraints of translation and synthesis  the adjuvant  used here was TLR3 agonist  33 34 . As a result  the adjuvant 50S ri  bosomal protein L7 L12  NCBI ID  P9WHE3  was evaluated to boost the  vaccine candidate  s immunogenicity. With the RS09  APPHALS   the  PADRE sequence  AKFVAAWTLKAAA  can break apart two b domains  with weakly interacting interactions over a wide range of peptide  lengths. The adjuvant RS09 is a synthetic agonist for the Toll like re  ceptor 3. It aids in the activation of both the innate and adaptive im  mune systems  35 . Innate immunity is activated by toll like receptors   as well as antigen presentation by Antigen Presenting Cells  APCs . A  PADRE sequence provides vaccine stability as well as adjuvant proper   ties  36 . In contrast  the selected CTL was linked with the help of AAY  linkers  31 37 . The AAY linker is a proteasome cleavage site that has  been exploited to modify protein stability  decrease immunogenicity   and improve epitope presentation  38 .  2.4. Structural analysis of vaccine  The physiochemistry of a protein describes its fundamental charac   teristics. To gain a comprehensive understanding of how the vaccine  serves its purpose  the ProtParam server predicted the physicochemical  properties of the vaccine  39 . We also evaluated the immunological  properties through VaxiJen v2.0  23   MHC I immunogenicity  28    AllerTop  30   and SOLpro  40  servers. SOPMA  Self Optimized Pre  diction Method with Alignment  server identifies the two dimensional   2D  structural features of the construct  such as the   helix    turn   and random coils  41 42  and PSIPRED v4.0 server  43  with default  parameters. SOPMA has a prediction accuracy of above 80   41 . To  further understand the composition quality of the vaccine  2D structural  properties were collected and evaluated.  2.5. Prediction and confirmation of tertiary structure  The constructed vaccine was submitted to the Raptorx server  44   45 . Using a cutting edge algorithm and a 3D structure  the Raptorx  server produces the most precise structure of the protein and its activ  ities  44 . The C score  TM score value  RMSD  and top five models of a  particular protein sequence may all be predicted and determined using  this web service. The generated 3D structure was saved as a PDB file   which was chosen based on the C score. The C score on the server ranges  from  5 to 2  with a higher number indicating a more confident protein  model. For the refining of the vaccine structure  the discovered 3D S.I. Islam et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100948 3structure was uploaded to the GalaxyRefine online web based server.  The CASP10 refining approach was used to operate this web server  46 .  The RMSD  energy score  and overall quality score are all available on  the GalaxyRefine website. The improved structure was downloaded  and  the chosen structure was determined using the energy scores of the  lowest and maximum RMSD values. We used the Ramachandran plot  score  vaccine structure validity  and Z score value  which indicates the  standard deviation from the mean value of the 3D structure of the  vaccine. PROCHECK server was used to analyze Ramachandran plot   which runs most allowed and disallowed amino acid regions  and  ProSA web to analyze Z score plot  47 .  2.6. Disulfide engineering of the designed vaccine  The intended model must be stable before proceeding with docking  analysis. Disulfide bonds provide a geometrically stable protein struc  ture. Disulfide by Design 2.0  48  was used to assign such bonds for the  designed vaccine.  2.7. Molecular docking  Molecular docking investigations can show the binding interactions  between modeling proteins and receptor molecules. We did this by  submitting the refined vaccination model as a ligand and the TLR5 as an  immunological receptor to the ClusPro v2.0 server for molecular dock  ing  49 . The TLR5 receptor was chosen and downloaded from the PDB  server  PDB ID  3V44 . Separating the associated ligand from the protein  was the first step in preparing the receptor  which was followed by the  removal of water and other chemicals. All of these procedures were  carried out using the PyMOL v2.3.4 program  50 . Discovery Studio  2017 and PBDSum were used to investigate binding interactions and  residues in the interacting surface.  2.8. MD simulation and normal mode analysis  The binding stability of the selected candidate compounds to the  target protein to the active site cavity of the protein was investigated  using 50 ns molecular dynamic simulations  MDS   51 . To analyze the  thermodynamic stability of the receptor ligand complex  the MDS of the  receptor ligand complex was done using the  Desmond v6.3 Program   in  Schr odinger 2020  3 under Linux framework  52 . Following the con  struction of the solvated system with protein in complex with the ligand   the system has been minimized using OPLS 2005 force field parameters  in addition to the standard protocol introduced in the Desmond module   52 . Finally  the simulation was carried out for 50 ns  and RMSF  RMSD   and Protein secondary structure elements from the trajectories were  analyzed to reveal the stability of the vaccine complex. Molecular dy  namics is a computational approach that was applied in order to  describe the molecules behavior as well as measure the stability of  protein  protein complexes  53 . The binding stability and flexibility of  the protein and ligand complex was analyzed using iMODS server   http   imods.Chaconlab.org    which performs Normal Mode Analysis   NMA  in internal  dihedral  coordinates using an elastic network model   ENM   54 . This tool estimates the direction and range of the basic  motions of the protein  ligand complex by measuring four main factors   deformability  eigenvalues  B factors and covariance. Generally  defor   mation is much harder when the eigenvalue is high  54 .  2.9. Immune response simulation  The complete construct was uploaded to the C IMMSIM v10.1 server  for evaluation of the possible immunological response of the vaccine   55 . In this circumstance  we employed a minimum interval of 30 days  between two doses  as previously specified  56 . One time step equals 8  h in real life  and three injections were administered in three separate  simulations with 1 time step  84 times  and 168 times  respectively. With the maximum simulation step value set to 300  all other stimulation  parameters were left at their default settings.  2.10. Codon adaptation and in silico cloning  Codon optimization is required to express a foreign gene in a host   57 . As a result  the construct was uploaded to the JCat service for  codon adaptation  http   jcat.de   . We employed the commonly used  E. coli K12 as the host in this study. The codon adaptation index  CAI   value and guanine cytosine  GC  concentration of the modified  sequence were used to evaluate it  57 . Lastly  the in silico cloning of the  adapted nucleotide sequence into the pET28a     expression vector was  performed using the modified nucleotide sequence. SnapGene v4.2  software was used to carry out the entire in silico cloning procedure   58 . The RNAfold server was also used to assess the efficiency of  translation and the thermodynamic stability of expressed mRNA se  quences  59 .  3.Results  3.1. Analysis of the proteins  After analyzing proteomic data three proteins RNA dependent RNA  polymerase  RdRp   polyprotein  PP   and major capsid protein VP2   MCPVP2  of marine birnavirus  MABV  were selected  as they were  found non allergen. CTLPred server results 174 epitopes for RNA   Dependent RNA polymerase  230 epitopes for polyprotein  and 201 for  major capsid protein VP2  that were analyzed based on their best overall  interaction score to MHC Supertypes A1  B27  and A3  also mention  from 12 MHC types . We predict the subcellular location of these pro  teins and the transmembrane helices. Subcellular location is very  important for developing drugs and vaccines as well as transmembrane  helices. We predicted the transmembrane helices of these three proteins  in a suitable number  Table 1 . Vaxijen Server predicts the antigenicity  of the proteins RdRp  0.4093   PP  0.5008   and MCPVP2  0.4965    Table 1 .  3.2. Prediction of epitopes  The selected target proteins were screened for CTL epitopes. A list of  the top three CTL epitopes for each protein which was non toxic  non   allergenic  non toxic  and immunogenic  was compiled  Table 2 .  3.3. The structure of a vaccine and its fundamental characteristics  The vaccine was created utilizing epitopes from CTL distinct class  that had previously been chosen. AAY linkers were used to link epitopes  together. To enhance immunogenicity  an adjuvant was applied before  the construct. An adjuvant was attached to the CTL epitope with the  RS09  APPHALS  and PADRE sequence as a linker to activate TLR3 by  ribosomal protein the 50S L12 as an agonist. The final vaccination had a  length of 255 amino acids  Fig. 1 .  3.4. Immunological assessment and physicochemical characteristics  Table 3 shows the physicochemical parameters of the vaccine  construct. The construct was discovered to have a molecular weight of  26638.28 Da. Other features such as the theoretical isoelectric point  pI   of 4.82  the chemical formula of C1196H1900N302O375S4  the instability  index of 17.36  the aliphatic index of 88.35  and the grand average of  hydropathicity of 0.013 were also present. The physicochemical prop  erties and immunological efficacy of the construct were also evaluated.  The antigenicity of the construct was 0.6964  whereas its immunoge   nicity was positive. Furthermore  the vaccine was found to be soluble  with a score of 0.81177 out of 1  Table 3 .   helix    strand  and random  coils were examined utilizing two distinct servers as secondary S.I. Islam et al.

On the other hand  the PSIPRED  server anticipated the features as 58.823    helix  7.45    strand  and  33.725  random coils  Table 4   Fig. 2 .  3.5. Refinement and confirmation of the tertiary structure  The top five homology models were built using RaptorX as the best template. Out of the five models  we selected the one with the lowest C   score   4.63 . The 3D representation of the produced vaccine is shown  in Fig. 3. Before refinement  the Ramachandran plot of the vaccine  revealed that 74.2  of residues were in the most favorable zone  20.5   in the additional allowed region  and 3.5  in the disallowed region.  However  after refinement  79  of the residues in the most favorable  region were found in the Ramachandran plot  and 14  in additional  allowed regions  while 3.1  in disallowed regions were seen in Fig. 4   B . The Z score was  6.34 of the crude model whereas Z score was   6.61 of the refine model  Fig. 4 D  .  3.6. Vaccine disulfide engineering  To stabilize the vaccine design  disulfide engineering was employed.  In the case of our vaccine  the DbD2 server found that there were 30  pairs of amino acids with the potential to make disulfide bonds. With  other parameters such as energy and the chi3 value taken into account   two pairs of mutations with cysteine were recommended. Thus  SER37   CYS91 and ARG81 CYS95 were the residue pairs with the highest  number of mutations. Energy and chi3 have approved values of less than  4.59 and 107.11   110.24  correspondingly.  3.7. Molecular docking research  To predict their binding affinity and interactions  the vaccine   ligand  and TLR5  receptor  were docked. As a result  the ClusPro v2.0  server produced nine docked complexes in various positions. We chose  the complex with the lowest energy score and the binding posture with  functional interactions from among them. As a consequence  model 7  satisfied the inclination requirement. As a result  it was chosen as the  best vaccine  TLR5 complex  with a  967.5 energy score. Binding in  teractions and residues implicated in active site residues were investi   gated in the chosen complex. A total of 3 hydrogen bonds were found on Table 1  Details of the Antigenic vaccine candidate proteins.

The interacting residues in the CHB from the  vaccine were THR78   ALA231  Distance 3.13     TYR283   ARG 252   Distance 3.10    and ASN328   THR251  Distance 2.95   . A single salt  bridge bond is also predicted in GLU460 LYS27  Distance 3.98     Moreover  associated TLR3 active site residues were shown in Fig. 5. 3.8. MD simulation and Normal Mode Analysis  The root mean square deviation  RMSD  of both the vaccine complex  and the vaccine was calculated. The average RMSD value for the vaccine  complex was 4.58    which demonstrates the structural stability during  the interaction. From Fig. 6  it can be observed that the vaccine complex  has the initial increase of RMSD descriptors till 10 ns  and after that  it  showed stability till 20 ns  A lower degree of fluctuation was observed  from 20 to 30 ns  which may be responsible for structural integrity and   or to allow firm binding. Furthermore  the root mean square fluctuation   RMSF  score was used to assess protein flexibility across amino acid  residues. The RMSF profile of the vaccine complex indicates maximum  amino acid residues from complexes that an RMSF profile below 4.0    and greater change were observed for fewer residues. Fig. 7 shows the  stability and stiffness of the vaccine complex. Molecular dynamics is a  computational approach that was applied in order to describe the mol  ecules behavior as well as measure the stability of protein  protein  complexes  53 .  3.9. Immune response simulation  As demonstrated in Fig. 8  the simulated immune response resembled  genuine immunological events induced by certain infections. Secondary  and tertiary immune responses  for instance  were greater than primary  Fig. 2.Prediction of the secondary structure of designed epitope vaccines using PSI PRED.

There were also secondary and  tertiary responses  which were associated with higher antibody levels   IgG1 IgG2  IgM  and IgG  IgM   which led to significantly increased  antigen clearance after subsequent exposures  Fig. 8 A  . In addition  B   cells  cytotoxic T cells  and helper T cells had a longer survival time   indicating IgM memory development and class flipping between im  mune cells  Fig. 9 B D  .  3.10. Codon adaptation and in silico cloning  To improve the translation efficiency of the vaccine design  we  adjusted the codons according to the E. coli K12 on the JCat service. The  nucleotide sequences created by the peptide vaccine construct  255 AA  residues  totaled 471 lengths  Fig. 10 . Furthermore  the modified  nucleotide sequence has a GC content of 51.9147  and a CAI value of  1.0  respectively. To insert the changed sequence into the pET28a      vector  we employed the XhoI and BamHI restriction sites as the start  and end cut points  respectively. The improved vaccine design was  cloned into the pET28a     cloning vector using the SnapGene software  Fig. 11 . The RNA fold server was used to predict the secondary  structure of mRNA. mRNA structure displays thermodynamic stability  with  247.00 kcal mol minimum free energy. Additionally  there were  no pseudoknots or long stable hairpins in the first 10 nucleotides of  mRNA secondary structure  thus providing efficient translation initia   tion  Fig. 12 .  4.Discussion  The marine birna virus  MABV  has a wide host range. The infection  cycle across different species  on the other hand  is not well understood.  MABV transmission from host to host must be understood in order to  control MABV related infections and minimize their proliferation in  aquaculture environments  5 . Previous research showed that different  strain of MABV has specific virulence in different fish species however   major capsid protein VP2 and RdRp protein are the potential cause of  virus replication in fish species  5 8 . Furthermore  as compared to web  lab experiments  epitope based vaccines against viral pathogens of fin  fishes and shellfishes have been relatively successful  60 61 . The entire  Fig. 4.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100948 10idea of EBVs is new and simple to implement for everyone. Vaccines  based on epitopes of shrimp have already been proven effective in  chickens. Therefore  such vaccines are needed for finfishes as well  62 .  Previously  Edwardsiella tarda   Vibrio harveyi and Flavobacterium colum   nare  three devastating fish pathogens were targeted successfully by  in silico epitope based subunit vaccine candidates  63 64 . Because  T cell epitopes bind well with MHC Class I molecules  they can elicit a  primary immunological response in the hosts  65 . The current diabol   ical emergence of infectious from marine birnavirus  MABV  poses a  danger to the worldwide aquaculture industry  which influences us to  use an immunoinformatics method to build this epitope based subunit  vaccine. The vaccination based on the virulent proteins displayed  outstanding relevance as predicted by immunoinformatics  proving our  effort to be reliable. A vaccine protects against infectious illnesses safely  and effectively  66 . Acquired immunity against contagious diseases  should be possible with it  67 . As a result of this study  we designed a  vaccine based on epitopes that would provide a strong immune response  to MABV . MABV infection and transmission are difficult to control and  prevent in the absence of an effective vaccine. Furthermore  to regulate  the current situation  effective immunization has yet to be produced. As  a result  a novel vaccine development strategy is critical to finding a solution to the current economically threatening aquaculture problem   especially for Asian seabass. Because the polyprotein  RNA dependent  RNA polymerase  and major capsid protein VP2 of MABV are impor   tant for immunological invasion and transmission  our goal was to  develop an epitope based subunit immunization that targeted the most  virulent protein. To enable cellular and humoral immune systems to  recognize this protein  all the virulent protein selected through in silico  screening was evaluated for its antigenic region. The first step was  identifying all possible CTL epitopes. Next  the vaccine was designed  with antigenic epitopes   CTL  since the linkers below corresponded to  the top epitopes. CTL epitopes were used in vaccine development as an  important component that improves the stability  folding  and tran  scriptional regulation of our peptide vaccine  68 . Adjuvants are  attached to CTL epitopes with RSO9 and PADREE sequences as linkers   which make the vaccine more stable and durable  as well as enhance  cellular and humoral immunogenic responses  69 . A total of 255 amino  acid residues were found in the vaccine construction. An essential  characteristic of a recombinant vaccine is its solubility  a type of phys  icochemical property  70 . A solubility assessing tool was used to  determine whether the vaccine construct was solvable inside the host  E. coli  and the results showed that it was solvable.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100948 11constructed vaccine  as indicated by the theoretical PI value  was acidic.  The stability index of the vaccine sequence  as recommended by server  tools  indicates that it will be stable following synthesis. The GRAVY  value and aliphatic index  on the other hand  indicated that the vaccine  was hydrophilic and thermostable  respectively. According to the pre  diction of physicochemical properties and scores on all parameters   there is a high probability for this vaccine to be a valid candidate against  MABV. The detected models were revised and the best model  based on  the lowest energy score  was chosen after the 3D structure prediction   based on c score . We observed the Z score   6.68  and superior fea  tures of the most favored  acceptable  and prohibited areas for the  Ramachandran plot in the validation test of the 3D structure. It was  suggested by the lowest energy score of Vaccine TLR5 complexes  respectively  from a molecular docking suggested that the vaccine could  have infection inhibiting activity and might interact tightly with these  receptors. TLR5 in Teleosts has a proclivity for flagellin protein  thus we  employed flagellin head and tail residual peptides in EBV crafting  and it  was discovered to have a function in inducing inflammatory responses  and developing innate immunity in fish  71 72 . The molecular dy  namics simulation is a potentially useful tool for understanding how  proteins function and how their structure is derived. Anatomical  movement can be simulated by protein dynamic simulations as a func  tion of time. We have performed dynamic simulations of the vaccine  candidate for 50 ns and analyzed the results using the RMSD and RMSF  scores. When comparing distinct atomic conformations of a molecular  system  the RMSD value is employed. Significant flexibility and depar   ture of vaccine candidates from receptor structure was determined using  the RMSD value  whereas the displacement of our particular vaccine  candidate atoms from receptor structure was determined using RMSF of  the complex structure. The calculated average RMSD and RMSF value  was 4.58   and 4.0    respectively. The fluctuation was not observed to  be larger in the vaccine section  but it smoothed out after 25 ns  sug  gesting that the modeled vaccine and receptor are stable. Lastly  we  examined the optimal target clearance and cell density parameters for  the best immunologic response against the pathogen by constructing an  immune simulation. As a result of the upgraded vaccine doses  the im  mune system created memory B cells  with a half life of several months   and T cells. The vaccination efficiently imitated a humoral immune  response to increased immunoglobulin production in this way. To optimize the epitope vaccine production  the MD simulation was done to  evaluate the stability of the vaccine candidate with the receptor  in  which codon optimization was done for the stability of the construct  vaccine within the host. Eventually  the codon was adjusted  and in  silico cloning of the intended vaccine candidate into the E. coli K12  expression host pET28a     vector was successful.  5.Conclusions  MABV genome and structure have been extensively studied  but  controlling MABV is still lacking and it has become a re emerging dis  ease for aquaculture. A range of computational techniques was used in  this work to find possible CTL epitopes in MABV virulent proteins  which  were finally stitched into an epitope based subunit vaccine. Recently  developed vaccine possesses the immuno dominant qualities that are  sought. Significantly  it was capable of binding to the immunological  receptors and induces a substantial immune response in favor of MABV  infection. Based on our findings  we believe that preparing a vaccine  against the etiological mediator of the MABV epidemic in fish should  begin with the vaccine candidate. In addition  the possible epitopes  discovered in this study can be employed in future research. Neverthe   less  a more wet lab experiment is needed to show that our designed  vaccine is an effective preventive against MABV.
