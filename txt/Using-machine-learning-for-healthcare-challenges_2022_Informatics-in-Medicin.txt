When enhanced computational power is combined with big data  there is an  opportunity to use ML algorithms to improve health care. Supervised learning is the type of ML that can be implemented to predict labeled data based on algorithms  such as linear or logistic regression  support vector machine  decision tree  LASSO regression  K Nearest Neighbor  and Naive Bayes classifier. Unsupervised ML  models can identify data patterns in datasets that do not contain information about the outcome. Such models can be used for fraud or anomaly detection. Examples  of clinical applications of ML include the formulation of various clinical decision support systems. An important public health application of ML is the identification  and prediction of populations at high risk for developing certain adverse health outcomes and the development of public health interventions targeted to these  populations. Various concepts related to ML need to be integrated into the medical curriculum so that health professionals can effectively guide and interpret research  in this area.    1.Introduction  Machine learning  ML  is an old concept that has recently gained a  lot of attention due to the explosion of data generation processes in  healthcare. According to one report  approximately 86  of healthcare  organizations use some form of ML solutions  and more than 80  of  healthcare organization leaders have an artificial intelligence  AI  plan   1 2 . ML is an important discipline in the larger field of AI. ML is  defined as  the ability of a machine to mimic intelligent human behavior     3 . An algorithm is trained to learn from data and then make decisions  based on similar characteristics or variables from new data  4  The  intersection of various disciplines  especially mathematics  statistics   and computer science  is an important essence of the data science  required to implement various ML models  5  Despite the power of  human intelligence  humans tend to make mistakes because of their  limited short term memory  6 . When the tremendous growth in data is  combined with the increasing ability of computers to process and use the  data to formulate various machine learning algorithms  there is an op  portunity to use machine learning to help humans make decisions by  taking into account a significant amount of contextual information.6  Recently  ML has been used in a variety of medical disciplines that  include heart failure management  clinical decision support in clinical  medicine  and medical imaging  7 9 .  Compared with traditional hypothesis driven statistical analysis  ML focuses on the predictive accuracy of a model.10 Epidemiologic methods  have traditionally driven the process of data generation in health care.  Although the methods of ML allow for new ways to answer various  questions  the lack of effective integration between the two disciplines is  a major challenge  especially when data scientists and epidemiologists  communicate as a team  10 . It has also been argued that although many  different terminologies are used in these disciplines  different words are  used for overlapping or nearly the same concepts.10 Because epidemi   ologists and statisticians have long used such concepts in  hypothesis driven research  it is fairly easy for them to understand these  concepts if they are sensitized to the fact that ML only applies these  concepts with a new framework in mind. In addition  other healthcare  professionals such as clinicians  public health physicians  pathologists   and radiologists are more familiar with hypothesis driven research than  with ML algorithms. Therefore  it is necessary to convey the conceptual  parallelism between the two different but closely related disciplines.  With this narrative review  we aim to provide an overview of several  relevant ML concepts and the scope of their potential implementation in  healthcare. Emphasis is placed on explaining the classification of ML  models and the details of the various algorithms that can be used. This  methodological review provides an overview of different relevant ML  algorithms to make an informed decision.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100924 21.1. Type of machine learning models  ML models are divided into supervised learning  unsupervised  learning  and reinforcement learning  depending on the problem we are  trying to solve  10 12 .   1. Supervised Learning  Supervised ML models are used in situations when the outcome of  interest is specified  and data is explicitly labeled for the outcome  11 .  For example  the outcome may be the presence or absence of a disease  like diabetes or hypertension. One requirement for these models is that  since we are training the model based on the outcome labels in the data   we need to be sure that those labels are correct. Any bias in outcome  assessment will also affect the performance of the formulated model  and  therefore  make the prediction less generalizable to the population  outside the dataset on which the model is trained. The process of  formulating a supervised ML model is explicitly defined and matured  since these models are being used quite frequently. In order to formulate  a supervised ML model  the first step is to come up with a problem  statement followed by identification of the needed data that is relevant  to the problem of our interest  13 . Processing of the data is an impor   tant step that must be undertaken that may involve data wrangling   limiting the data to needed variables  and removing other variables   14 . One popular method is choosing a random sample of the data   choosing an algorithm  training the model  and evaluating the model  made  13 . There are several types of algorithms that we can choose.  One way is to train the model using several relevant algorithms and  check the performance of these models using confusion matrix and  receiver operating curve  ROC   15 . Coming up with a final model is an  iterative process. An algorithm is selected with the best possible com  bination of parameters to ensure the maximum possible predictive  ability for the model.16 Some methods papers have suggested default  values for different parameters to minimize hyperparameter tuning time  and computational effort  16 .  1.2. Different algorithms used for supervised machine learning  The algorithms used in supervised learning can be broadly divided  into regression and classification algorithms based on the prediction of a  quantitative or categorical variable  17 18 .   a regression algorithms  1.2.1. Linear regression  Linear regression is one of the most used algorithms developed to  predict a quantitative variable using one or more independent variables  with the assumption that the independent variables and the outcome  variables have a linear regression with each other  19 . Because of its  wide use  this algorithm is widely understood  and therefore it is easy for  health professionals to interpret it compared to other ML algorithms.  1.2.2. Support Vector Machine Regression  Sometimes quantitative dependent variable does not have a linear  relationship with the predictors. In such a case  support vector machine  regression is one suitable option to predict the outcome variable  20 .  Advantages of using Support Vector Machine Regression include its  ability to accurately predict without compromising generalizability and  its ability to be robust to outliers. This model is unsuitable for a few  situations  like dealing with a large dataset  20 . Similarly  when there  are many variables  and the sample size is lesser than the number of  variables  this model might not be suitable  20 .  1.2.3. Decision Tree Regression  Decision Tree Regression is a model used to predict a quantitative variable by asking several questions in the form of true and false. The  model predicts when it is confident to make a correct prediction at an  appropriate point  21 . One important strength of this algorithm is its  intuitive interpretation because it is near to how human beings think  and predict an outcome by asking many questions  21 . This is a  non parametric method meaning that this model does not have a strict  assumption about the distribution of the outcome variable  21 .  1.2.4. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression  Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator  LASSO  regression  penalizes the coefficients that do not contribute significantly to the  prediction of the outcome variables  22 . As a result  some coefficients  may become zero and therefore only the variables that better predict the  outcome variables are selected  22 .   b Classification algorithms  1.2.5. Logistic regression  Logistic regression is a commonly used classification algorithm that  predicts a categorical outcome in situations where the outcome has two  levels  23 . A disadvantage of logistic regression is that interactions  must be added manually  24 . Multinomial logistic regression predicts  categorical variables with more than two levels  24 .  1.2.6. K Nearest Neighbors  This simple prediction algorithm is known for its ease of imple   mentation and interpretation  18 25 . This model does not require the  setting of many parameters  25 . This algorithm slows down as the  number of predictor variables increases  25 . The result is categorized  based on the majority vote of the neighboring data points near the point  of interest. For this purpose  the Euclidean  Manhattan  and Minkowski  distances are used.  1.2.7. Na ve Bayes classifier  This classifier is used based on Bayes  theorem  26 . This algorithm  is well suited for predicting outcomes with more than two levels  27 . In  situations where the assumption of independence holds  less training  data is required than in logistic regression  27 . Although independence  of the predictor variables is assumed  in most cases the variables are not  independent in the real world.  1.2.8. Decision tree classification  The decision tree can be used to predict a categorical variable and  uses an approach called recursive partitioning  which further divides the  decision space into smaller and smaller areas and then labels this space   28 . An important strength of the decision tree is its ability to easily  adapt to a clinical context and its better interpretability compared to  other algorithms. In a clinical setting  this algorithm makes the predic   tion and tells the decision maker the exact reason for that prediction. It is  also well suited to classify unknown data sets  28 . As the number of  variables increases  it becomes difficult to interpret the decision tree   28 . These models are often biased toward splits on variables with  multiple levels  28 . The decision tree is quite sensitive to small changes  in the training data  28 .   2. Unsupervised Learning  The outcome is not specified in unsupervised ML  and the data is not  labeled. The algorithm has to identify and infer patterns from data  without an outcome variable  29 . Different methods can be used for  unsupervised learning. Clustering is one method in which data is split  into groups through an algorithm  29 . One needs to be cautious about  making decisions based on clusters because cluster analysis over  estimates similarity between groups  29 . Unsupervised ML techniques  can be used to identify an unusual pattern in the data and detect an  anomaly that can be a possible fraud  29 . When there are many A.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100924 3features  dimensionality reduction can be used to reduce the features in  the dataset  29 .   3. Reinforcement Learning  Reinforcement learning is one type and a practical application of ML.  A sequence of models is made to make some decisions  12 . The system  takes some action and gets feedback based on that action. The decisions  and resulting actions are modified based on the received feedback. The  process starts with trial and error  and this artificially intelligent system  learns from the feedback received. The feedback is incorporated as  subsequent decisions and actions are modified until the system gives  favorable feedback. When different machine learning algorithms are  combined and organized in a creative way to make different decisions   get regular feedback  modify the decisions  and experiment on a range of  decision space until the final decisions are optimized based on the  outcome  12 . In healthcare  the decision is not linear  and that requires  considering a multitude of factors before making a decision  30 .  Reinforcement learning can be used to design a decision support system  to provide treatment recommendations to the physicians  30 . There are  several challenges when adopting reinforcement learning to healthcare   like evaluating the decision made by this system and choosing the  reward to modify the decision and action  30 . This model also requires  understanding the disease dynamics and contextually establishing the  causal relationships between the relevant factor and the outcome  30 .  1.3. Application of ML in different areas of healthcare   1. Clinical Decision Support Systems in Healthcare  There are several examples of ML methods and algorithms used to  formulate a clinical decision support system  CDSS  to assist clinicians.  One example is the use of an ensemble model of four different models  i.  e.  a neural network  a gradient boosted decision tree  a support vector  machine  and logistic regression to stratify the mortality risk of patients  with infection COVID 19  31 . Similarly  a CDSS has been formulated to  reduce prescribing errors by helping to prioritize prescription checks   32 33 . A similar support system can also be formulated to help the  pharmaceutical industry select a candidate molecule for research that is  more likely to pass through regulatory processes and reach the market as  a drug  34 . Maternal health initiatives can use a CDSS to predict ectopic  pregnancies  35 . CDSSs have been developed to use imaging data such  as positron emission tomography and computed tomography to predict  lung cancer so that it can be treated in a timely manner  36 . Many other  examples include CDSS assisting in the treatment of periodontal disease   early detection of circular RNAs  detection of shock conditions  and  assisting in self referral decisions for back pain  37 39 . A deep learning  algorithm has been used to detect diabetic retinopathy in patients with  diabetes  40 .  A common concern when implementing ML algorithms is whether  such an implementation can be as good as expert opinion. One research  group formulated a deep neural network algorithm and mimicked the  diagnostic skills of experienced dermatologists to detect skin cancer   41 . A similar study reported that a nested neural network algorithm  performed comparably to an experienced radiologist in predicting dis  ease based on chest x rays.   2. Use of machine learning in Public Health  Population level healthcare outcomes can be predicted by ML algo  rithms using large data sets  42 . ML algorithms are advantageous when  there are large data sets and a non linear relationship between the  outcome and other independent variables. Several ML algorithms are  reproducible  and the true essence of these algorithms lies in the un  derlying authentic and high quality data. Predictive models are not new  in health care  an example being the Framingham health score formulated in 1967  43 . Although parametric statistics have been used  in the past to predict various population level outcomes  there is a recent  need and interest in using various ML algorithms to predict these out  comes  44 . Although the theoretical knowledge and principles used in  formulating ML models have been around for some time  there has been  a recent explosion in the process of generating a large amount of vari  able data at high velocity in various public health organizations  45 . In  addition  the improved ability to process data through various hardware  and cloud solutions has enhanced our ability to effectively use complex  algorithms for Big Data  46 . Examples of the use of ML to improve  population health include the prediction of childhood lead poisoning   the occurrence of suicidal ideation  the detection of diabetic retinop   athy  the management of public health emergencies  and the incidence  of yellow fever  44 47 48 . A review of population health prediction  through ML found that the most used algorithms to predict public health  outcomes were neural networks  support vector machines  and single  tree based models  44 . The same review found that ML algorithms were  commonly used to predict communicable and noncommunicable dis  eases but were less likely to predict outcomes not related to disease  44   cardiovascular disease was the most predicted outcome. Behaviors such  as health care utilization were also predicted using various ML models   44 . ML algorithms used to predict population level health outcomes  used structured data from electronic medical records and other similar  sources  44 . Although unstructured data from multiple publicly avail  able data sources can be quite useful in predicting various health out  comes  this is not commonly practiced by public health practitioners.  1.4. Machine learning in the medical curriculum  With all advancements in the field ML  the increasing use of various  ML algorithms  and the ever increasing demand for better utilization of  data in healthcare  the next generation of healthcare providers will need  to know the concepts  potential and terms necessary to understand ML.  Knowledge of ML algorithms and relevant terminology will help to un  derstand and interpret relevant literature or lead research involving ML  algorithms. There is a need to educate public health professionals  epi  demiologists  clinicians  pathologists  radiologists  and other health care  professionals the various ML terminologies. Given the conceptual  interaction between data science and epidemiology  it is equally  important to train public health data scientists who have good epide   miologic acumen. It is recommended that some of these data science and  ML  related concepts be incorporated into the medical curriculum in the  long term  49 .  1.5. Challenges in implementing ML models in health care  Numerous challenges that arise in the application of ML algorithms  in healthcare need to be explored and discussed by experts  50 . Any  machine learning model depends on high quality data that are repre   sentative of the population to which the model s results are to be  generalized. Thus  if we intend to integrate ML models into health care   formulating effective data management at all levels becomes an essen   tial requirement. In addition  pipelines for data processing and ML with  user friendly front ends for the products must be formulated. These  pipelines can transform the raw data into datasets that can be used to  train various ML models. The relevant stakeholders need to formulate an  effective data governance strategy to leverage the generated data.  Another critical challenge is that prediction based on ML usually  does not provide reasons for the prediction unless models such as de  cision trees are used that allow intuitive interpretation  50 51 . In sit  uations where the ML model is used to predict a health outcome  the  legal procedures are not optimized in case of a potential error. This point  can be quite challenging in practice  given the complexity of legal pro  cedures in different countries. A. Alanazi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100924 41.6. Ethics and machine learning  As in any other area of research or clinical practice  it is necessary  that ethical principles be central to any decision making framework. It is  expected and indeed observed that new ethical dilemmas will arise with  the advent of new technologies  52 . Experts have argued that ethical  dilemmas related to ML algorithms can be categorized in the areas of  accountability  equity of resource allocation  and personal integrity   52 . One of the fundamental guiding principles of any ethical frame   work is  Do No Harm    so at a minimum  a predictive ML algorithm must  not be harmful  53 . It is critical to ensure algorithmic fairness when  generalizing the results of such an algorithm  54 . Low  and  middle income countries are particularly vulnerable to bias due to  generalizations based on such algorithms. This is due to the lack of legal  protection  the prevalence of bias against some minority groups  and the  lack of technical capacity  54 . Given these complex ethical dilemmas   there is a need to research and develop ethical guidelines to propose  solutions to these dilemmas. Similarly  we have seen that the algorithms  of ML tend to reinforce inequalities presented in the underlying data   50 55 . These inequalities may be based on gender  ethnicity  or racial  groups  50 . There is a need to conduct methodological research to  ensure that ML models do not reinforce these inequalities.  2.Conclusion and recommendations  Hypothesis driven research that uses epidemiologic and statistical  knowledge has long been practiced in health care. The recent generation  of large amounts of variable data  combined with the improved  computational power of high speed physical and virtual machines  has  allowed us to develop several predictive ML algorithms. These algo  rithms have enabled us to formulate several clinical decision support  systems and predict population based health parameters. With the  increasing demand for ML algorithms in health research and their  application in clinical practice  health professionals must receive the  necessary training to understand the various terminologies. It is equally  important that data scientists understand the conceptual parallels be  tween data science and various epidemiological concepts. Finally  it is  important to ensure that the ethical principle of  do no harm   is  observed when generalizing findings from these ML algorithms.
