Managing resources is one of the biggest  challenges that healthcare providers around the world face during the pandemic. Allocating the Intensive Care  Unit  ICU  beds   capacity is important since COVID 19 is a respiratory disease and some patients need to be  admitted to the hospital with an urgent need for oxygen support  ventilation  and or intensive medical care. In  the battle against COVID 19  many governments utilized technology  especially Artificial Intelligence  AI   to  contain the pandemic and limit its hazardous effects. In this paper  Machine Learning models  ML  were  developed to help in detecting the COVID 19 patients   need for the ICU and the estimated duration of their stay.  Four ML algorithms were utilized  Random Forest  RF   Gradient Boosting  GB   Extreme Gradient Boosting   XGBoost   and Ensemble models were trained and validated on a dataset of 895 COVID 19 patients admitted to  King Fahad University hospital in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The conducted experiments show that the  Length of Stay  LoS  in the ICU can be predicted with the highest accuracy by applying the RF model for pre  diction  as the achieved accuracy was 94.16 . In terms of the contributor factors to the length of stay in the ICU   correlation results showed that age  C Reactive Protein  CRP   nasal oxygen support days are the top related  factors. By searching the literature  there is no published work that used the Saudi Arabia dataset to predict the  need for ICU with the number of days needed. This contribution is hoped to pave the path for hospitals and  healthcare providers to manage their resources more efficiently and to help in saving lives.    1.Introduction  The quick spread of the Coronavirus Disease  COVID 19  worldwide  has threatened most healthcare systems. Generally  the rapid increase in  the number of infected patients has raised the demand for Intensive Care  Unit  ICU  beds  1 . The shortage in hospital resources and bed capacity  is one of the most critical factors that have an impact on increasing death  rates of COVID 19  2 . A study based on a sample of COVID 19 patients  collected from 88 US Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals indicated  that the risk of death for COVID 19 patients in ICU increased with the increase in the demand for the ICU compared to the period when the  demand rate was approximately 25  lower  3 .  Various measures were taken to address the lack of medical resources  issue  including following specific guidelines for prioritizing patients  and selecting those deserving of admission to the ICU for needed care  4   5 . Although these measures play a significant role in managing medical  resources  they  in turn  may put the lives of COVID 19 patients at risk   as happened in the United Kingdom when several patients adhered to  home quarantine  which led to their death  and their condition was not  discovered for a period up to two weeks  6 .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100937 2During the period of such crises  it is necessary to estimate the future  need for medical resources such as ICU beds and nasal oxygen support.  For such purposes  Artificial Intelligence  AI   namely Machine Learning   ML   has made a significant contribution during the COVID 19  pandemic  7 .  Several studies in the literature focused on predicting the number of  patients who need admission to the ICU  8 13 . Moreover  identifying  the factors that increase the likelihood of ICU admission are also  important  8 14 17 . Several factors play role in determining the need  for ICU admission for COVID 19 patients  e.g. air quality in the  geographical region  which could indicate the rate and severity of the  infection in specific countries  18 . Age also is an indicator  as Estiri  et al. stated that patients at age of 51 and above are more likely to be  hospitalized or face mortality risk  8 . Izquierdo et al. found that the  most common clinical characteristics determining admission to ICU  were fever  age  and tachypnea with without respiratory crackles  17 .  Aktar et al. illustrate the strong relationship between abnormal blood  parameters and the severity level of the disease in COVID 19 patients   16 . Subudhi et al. found that the amount of LDH  CRP  and O2 satu  ration had significant influence in making the ICU admission decision  while eGFRD60 ml min 1.73m2  and the percentages of lymphocytes  and neutrophils were useful in predicting mortality  13 . Moreover   Heldt et al. found that selected laboratory findings such as creatinine   blood lactate levels  and clinical indicators of patient oxygenation were  most predictive of endpoints for COVID 19 patients. Furthermore  pa  tient age and measures of oxygen status during the ED stay can help in  the initial prediction of poor patient outcomes  9 .  By searching the literature  there are no published studies that tar  geted developing machine learning models to estimate the needed  number of days in the ICU for COVID 19 patients in Saudi Arabia which  is the focus of this study. Also  in this work  the most relevant features  related to the ICU admission for COVID 19 patients in Saudi Arabia are  being determined.  The research conducted in this paper aims at    1. Reviewing the published works that aimed at predicting the need of  COVID 19 patients for ICU admission and the expected number of  days to be spent in the unit worldwide.   2. Developing machine learning models to predict and estimate the  number of days COVID 19 patients in Saudi Arabia may spend in the  ICU to assist health sectors to better manage their resources and  determine their readiness to receive new patients and provide the  needed care for them.   3. Identifying the most relevant features that indicate the patient  s need  for ICU and the expected length of stay in the unit.  The rest of this paper is organized as follows  Section 2 presents the  related works  section 3 introduces the methodology  section 4 explains  the conducted experiments  and the experimental results are discussed  in Section 7. Finally  section 8 concludes the paper and presents future  research directions.  2.Related works  The spread of COVID 19 had a significant impact on the healthcare  systems around the globe. In particular  on the availability of beds in the  intensive care unit. This pandemic increased the research community  s  interest in finding practical solutions to mitigate the effects of this  problem  such as prediction models for ICU admissions  length of stay in  ICU  and discharge date. To conduct our research  over 41 papers were  reviewed. The main focus was on the latest published works in high  reputed journals to analyze the effectiveness of ML models and algo  rithms in solving the problems of resource shortage.  Many studies have tackled the issue of predicting the need for  different hospital resources for COVID 19 patients  and some of them  have utilized machine learning for that goal. Works that identify the related features for ICU admission are also reviewed. The below dis  cussion reviews the related works and their used methods. It also pro  vides a summary table of the related works in terms of aim  method   dataset  features  and results.  Epstein and Dexter  19  have designed an analytical model to predict  the future need for beds and ventilators during the COVID 19 pandemic  for a specific hospital by analyzing its internal data. The model used  COVID 19 data of admitted patients to estimate the number of days they  may need a ventilator. The authors found that there is no relationship  between gender and duration of hospitalization  or between age and the  need for ventilators. The performance of the model was good as the  mean absolute error of the daily prediction was small D1.25 patients    day for the census  and D0.5 ventilators day for ventilators. However   the results of the model could not be generalized  as the authors rec  ommended resetting the input parameters for each hospital to achieve  more accurate results.  In contrast with the previous study  L opez Cheda et al. in  20  found  that gender and age affect the stay duration in the ICU. They applied a  non parametric model to predict the LoS of COVID 19 patients in ICU  and the time to discharge or death. They simulated the COVID 19 hos  pital demand using a Monte Carlo algorithm. The results found that the  LoS in hospital is 11 days on average.  The work of Henzi et al.  presented in  21   has also demonstrated  that gender has an effect on the LoS in the ICU. A semi parametric model  to probabilistically predict the LoS of COVID 19 patients in ICU was  applied. The model was trained using data from patients with acute  respiratory distress syndrome  ARDS  and validated using data of  COVID 19 patients. The results indicated that the LoS for females tended  to be shorter than that for males.  Researchers are often interested in improving prediction scenarios  that influence public decision guidance. To this end  Lapidus et al. in   22  conducted a study to assess the average LoS  ALoS  for COVID 19  patients in ICU by examining two methods of estimation  the Dis  charged Patient Estimation  DPE  and the Censored Patient Estimation   CPE . Although the true ICU ALoS for the series was F21 days  which is  significantly higher than other reported estimates  they concluded that it  is possible to rely on the ALoS in decision making. They also recom   mended that censored patients should be included in the analysis along  with discharged cases to reduce the bias rate.  Dan et al. built a machine learning model to predict ICU admission   LoS in the ICU  and mortality of COVID 19 patients. The model could  predict events using clinical data collected within 1 15 days before  actual admission to the ICU. They found that the length of stay in the ICU  for elderly people with heart disease is high. Moreover  LoS in the ICU is  affected by abnormal values of many factors  namely lymphocyte ab  solute value  erythrocyte count  total cholesterol  adenovirus IgM anti  body  hypersensitive C reactive protein  high sensitivity troponin I  and  Q fever Rickettsia IgM antibody  23 .  Identifying the factors and the clinical characteristics that help in  predicting the admission of COVID 19 patients to the ICU is crucial too.  Hong et al. have described COVID 19 clinical characteristics outside of  Wuhan. They found that fever is not a permanent initial symptom of  COVID 19 as only 70  of the study sample reported this symptom. They  found also that age  weight  gender  and career are not affecting the  length of hospital stay. They designed a multivariate model to predict  the risk of a long hospital stay. Long periods of hospital stay increase  medical costs and increase the level of risk. Early estimation helps in  taking many decisions and allocating resources  24 .  Moreover  the research conducted by Gunduz et al. in  10  found  that the CHA2DS2 VASc  Congestive heart failure  hypertension  age   diabetes mellitus  stroke  vascular disease  and the M CHA2DS2 VASc   modified CHA2DS2 VASc  scores can be used to predict the need of ICU  admission  the LoS in the ICU  and mortality of COVID 19 patients.  Table 1 summarizes the related studies by showing their aim  the  used model and algorithm  the dataset  features  and the obtained re  sults. Table 2 shows the relationship between the LoS and some clinical D.A.

It  provides an overview of the approach  a brief about the machine  learning algorithms utilized  and the dataset description and preparation. The first step was to build the machine learning model. The  second was to collect the dataset and prepare it for processing. Then   experiments were conducted to select the best performing model. The  evaluation of the developed models then took place. The final step is to  utilize the developed model for the prediction purpose.  3.1. Overview of the proposed approach  This paper aims at prdicting the likelihood of COVID 19 patients for  ICU admission and the length of their stay using demographic and  clinical data of positive COVID 19 patients obtained from King Fahad  University Hospital in Dammam city in Saudi Arabia. The first step was  to review different machine learning algorithms and select the most  suitable ones to be utilized in developing the prediction models. Next   data pre processing was applied to recover the missing data and solve  the imbalanced data problem which is described in detail in section  3.3.2 . After that  the selected machine learning algorithms were trained  and validated on the selected dataset  once with and once without  applying feature selection  and by trying different k fold as demon   strated in section 4. The classification results of the developed models  were compared in the third stage which is described in section 5 to  identify the best performance model.  3.2. Machine learning algorithms  In this section  the machine learning classifiers used to build the  prediction models are discussed. Since the literature addressed different  classifiers as well known to perform with high accuracy to solve the  problem of developing prediction models for medical purposes  the first  task was to select the top classifiers and test their performance for our  proposed model. The selected classifiers are Random Forest RF  Gradient Table 1  Summary of works aimed at estimating the need and LoS in ICU for COVID 19 patients worldwide.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100937 4Boosting GB  Extreme Gradient Boosting XGBoost  and Ensemble model.  Based on  25   the most used ML algorithms for mortality  severity  and  length of stay in ICU are Random Forest RF and XGBoost. In their work   the prediction model attained its best result by utilizing RF which helped  to alarm the medical service providers in 6 h earlier that the patient must  be admitted to the ICU.  In the research addressed in  26   Random Forst outperforms other  classifiers in predicting COVID 19 affected cases  mortality  and cured  cases in India.  Also  these algorithms have been applied for many prediction pur  poses in the medical field such as breast cancer  diabetes  and other  diseases. For example  the work presented in  27  built a risk prediction  model that utilized RF and XGBoost algorithms for weighted feature  selection to diagnose type 2 diabetes. They stated that the best predic   tion accuracy was achieved by using RF. XGBoost classifier can be used  to predict accurately the infection with breast cancer  and it can achieve  the highest accuracy as discussed in  28 . Also in  29   GB and LR were  utilized to predict the need for recurrent bleeding  therapeutic inter  vention  and severe bleeding. The work demonstrated that the GB al  gorithm is a robust classification that can handle large input sizes and  fits with simple models to achieve higher accuracy.  The propsed models in this work were implemented using Python  programming language which provides several tools for machine  learning tasks.  Below is a brief description of the used classifiers to build the pro  posed models.   a. Random Forest  RF   The random forest  as the name implies  is made up of a huge number  of individual decision trees that work together as an ensemble. It works  to enhance accuracy by relying on a group of decision models rather  than a single learning model. The key distinction between this approach  and traditional decision tree algorithms is that the root nodes have  splitting nodes that are produced at random  30 . The trees protect each  other from their flaws  which explains why they have such a strong ef  fect. While some trees may estimate incorrect classification  many others  will be correct  allowing the trees to progress in the proper direction. As  a result  the predictions  and thus errors  generated by individual trees  must have minimal correlations with each other for the random forest to  perform well  31 . Furthermore  RF offers many advantages  such as the  ability to be utilized for both classification and regression tasks  and it  can process missing variables. Additionally  when additional decision  trees are added to the forest  overfitting is less likely to occur  32 .   b. Gradient Boosting  GB   Gradient boosting is a type of boosting technique that is an ensemble  mechanism for combining numerous simple models into a single com  posite model. The entire model becomes a stronger predictor when  additional simple models are introduced  33 . Each model attempts to  compensate for the flaws of its predecessor by selecting a random sample  of data  fitting it with a model  and then training it consecutively. Each  iteration combines the weak rules of each classifier to generate a single  and strong prediction rule  34 . Gradient boosting is a technique that  can be utilized for both regression and classification tasks  33 . It can  train many models in a progressive  cumulative  and sequential manner.  The input of GB is three requirements which are  loss function  predic   tion maker  weak learner  which is generally a decision tree  and an  additive model which minimizes the loss function by adding the weak  learners. The loss function describes how the dataset is modeled by the  algorithm. Mainly  it is the gap between actual and projected values. It  has a different function for each task. For example  for the classification  task  the binary cross entropy loss can be used. On the other hand  the  decision trees can be used as a weak learner to reduce the error gener   ated from the previous models and return a strong model  35 .  c. Extreme Gradient Boosting  XGBoost   Extreme Gradient Boosting is a fast open source version of the sto  chastic gradient boosting ensemble method which is donated as a scal  able tree boosting system. As an ensemble machine learning algorithm   XGBoost is built on decision tree models. Trees are introduced to the  ensemble one at a time and fit to correct the prediction mistakes caused  by preceding models  36 . XGBoost has been deployed on a variety of  challenges  and the results show that this algorithm produces  state of the art outcomes on a wide range of difficult problems  37 . It is  intended to be both computationally efficient  i.e. fast to execute  and  extremely effective. The most significant factor in XGBoost s success is  its scalability in all situations. On a single machine  the system operates  more than 10 times quicker than the existing popular solutions and  scales to billions of samples in distributed or memory limited scenarios.   d Ensemble Classifier  By integrating many models  ensemble learning aids in improving  machine learning results. This method is expected to produce greater  predictive performance than a single model because it employs a group  of classifiers rather than a single one to classify unknown data. The  ensemble s classifiers all anticipate the proper class of each unseen  instance  and their predictions are subsequently aggregated using some  kind of voting system  38 . It is only appropriate to employ this  approach if the output of multiple classifiers disagrees. Combining a  large number of identical classifiers provides no benefit. As a result   approaches for creating ensembles revolve around producing classifiers  that disagree with their predictions  39 . Table 3 discusses the strengths  and weaknesses of the selected prediction algorithms.  3.3. Data collection and preparation  This section describes the dataset used in the research and the pro  cess of data preparation and pre processing.  3.3.1. Data description  The dataset was obtained from King Fahad University hospital in  Dammam City at the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. Since the start of  the pandemic  this hospital was one of the main centers to receive and  treat COVID 19 patients from all cities in the eastern province. The  dataset consists of the clinical and demographics data of 895 patients  who attended to the hospital and tested positively for COVID 19. Each  patient record contained 47 features collected at admission time and  from the medical history of the patient  where each patient s record was  updated daily. Those features included a wide range of clinical and  demographics data that contains comorbidities  laboratory results  symptoms  and vital signs such as age  gender  obesity  smoking  vitamin  D def  fever  headache  liver disease  ferritin  LDH  AST  Trop  and other  data. The data set also contained the number of days each patient spent  in the ICU before being discharged or expired. The range of the days in  the data was between 0 and 58 days. For classification and prediction  purposes  these days were categorized in small intervals of 5 days and  given one label of 9 classes  from 1 to 9  to represent the LoS days data.  The Zero class was used to label COVID 19 patients who did not need to  attend the ICU. Class 1 was used to represent patients who entered the  ICU for less than 24 h. The remaining classes 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  and 9 were  used to represent the following period of days respectively  1 5  6 10   11 15 16 20  21 25  26 30  and more than 30 days.  3.3.2. Data preparation and preprocessing  The data preparation and preprocessing involved two tasks  first   filling in the missing data  second  solving the issue of imbalanced data.  Since the dataset contained some missing values  the KNN imputa   tion method was used to fill in these missing values. The KNN imputa   tion algorithm replaces the missing value with a value obtained from a D.A. Alabbad et al.

Besides the capability of  this algorithm of obtaining a closer value as much as possible and using  it in filling the missing value. The KNN imputation algorithm can pre  serve the normal distribution of the data which is very important in the  case of medical datasets  46 . Since the usage of different k values in the  KNN imputation algorithm can result in different results  the model  performance was the average of using four different k values  k  3  k   5  k  7  k  10  k  15.  Similar to a lot of other datasets  this dataset is considered an  imbalanced dataset. Fig. 1 shows the frequency of every class in the  attribute  Days to discharge from the ICU . As shown  the majority of the  records belong to class 0 while class 6 and class 7 had only 30 and 12  records respectively. This may make the model biased to class 0. The  imbalanced dataset is considered a problem as the model will not be able  to predict the minority classes because the model will focus only on  optimizing the accuracy without taking into consideration the overall  distribution of each class. To solve this imbalanced dataset issue  Syn  thetic Minority Oversampling Technique  SMOTE  was used. This  technique oversamples the minority class by creating  synthetic   examples rather than already existing examples  47 . Fig. 2 demon   strates the frequency of every class in the attribute  Days to discharge  from the ICU  after applying SMOTE technique in which all the classes  now have the same number of records which is 144 records.  Also  the dataset attributes were evaluated using the entropy eval  uation to understand how the impurity or the heterogeneity of the target  class is computed. Table 4 below demonstrates the result of the entropy  evaluation for each attribute.  4.Experiments  In order to achieve the goal of this research  a number of experiments  were conducted to test the performance of the four developed prediction  models mentioned earlier in section 3.2. The data were randomly  divided into two folds  80  for the training process  and the remaining  20  was for validation. All models were run using different K fold  values  3  5  7  10  and 15. The same dataset was used with each pre  diction model  and the performance was evaluated. Because the dataset  is imbalanced  we could not depend on one performance measure. In this  case  the performance measures included accuracy  the proportion of  correctly classified test records   precision  positive predictive value    recall  negative predicted value   and f score  the harmonic mean of  precision and recall . Also  feature selection was applied once with each  classifier using the Boruta algorithm to reduce the feature set each  model needs to handle. The developed models and their performance are  discussed in the below sections.  4.1. Model 1  random forest  RF   The first prediction model was built using RF classifier.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100937 6demonstrates the results obtained by this model on the validation set for  predicting the class of the number of days to discharge from ICU using  different values of K fold. The 3 fold achieved the highest accuracy  performance compared to the other K folds using the RF classifier. The results of RF classifier after the feature selection are shown in Table 6   which also shows that 3 fold provides the highest performance.  4.2. Model 2  gradient boosting  GB   The second model was developed using GB classifier  Table 7 and  Table 8 show the results of validating the model without and with  applying feature selection. Noticed that  the highest accuracy achieved  does not depend on the number of K fold where it was 88.14  with 15   fold before the feature selection and 87.29  with 3 fold after the feature  selection.  4.3. Model 3  Extreme Gradient Boosting  XGBoost   The third model was built using the XGBoost classifier which ach  ieved the highest accuracy with 3 fold with and without applying the  feature selection which was 91.49  and 90.80  respectively. Table 9   and Table 10 show the results obtained by using the third model with  XGBoost classifier.  4.4. Model 4  Ensemble Classifier  The fourth model was developed using the Ensemble classifier where  RF  GB  XGBoost  and Adaptive Boosting decisions techniques were  combined. The obtained results with this model are shown in Table 11  which achieved 93.13  accuracy without feature selection. Table 12  shows the results of the model with applying feature selection which  scored a slightly higher accuracy of 93.81 .  5.Experimental results and discussion  The goal of the presented research is to develop a machine learning  model that estimates the required number of days for COVID 19 patients  in the ICU to help healthcare providers to manage their resources and to  plan for the expected COVID 19 affected patients. For this purpose  four  prediction models were implemented using different ML classifiers with  multiple tuning of the parameters. The results show that each model  performed differently with the used dataset. By reviewing the obtained  results in the previous section  it can be deduced that with the majority  of the classifiers  using the full set of features improves the prediction  accuracy compared to applying features selection. Only Model 4  the  ensemble  showed slight improvement with feature selection using  Borota as the accuracy reached 93.81  compared to 93.13  before  applying the feature selection. Table 13 shows the results achieved by  each model by applying feature selection. Table 14 shows the highest  obtained results of each classifier without the feature selection. Results  were compared in order to identify the highest performance model.  Fig. 3 also shows the obtained accuracy of each model before and  after feature selection.  By comparing the obtained results of all models  we can see that  model 1  which applied the Random Forest  has achieved the highest  validation accuracy of 94.16  to predict the number of days range to  discharge from ICU by using 3 fold. It can be seen that RF provides the  best result in all performance measures as it scored 94.16   94.14    94.16   and 94.14  for accuracy  precision  recall  and F score Table 4  Entropy values for features included in the study.

For all developed models  feature selection did not contribute to  improving performance. The feature selection process was applied in hope of reducing overfitting  reducing training time  and improving  accuracy by eliminating irrelevant features. However  by applying the  feature selection  the performance was slightly decreased as the ach  ieved accuracy for the majority of the classifiers was less compared to  using the full set of features. This indicates that all used features  contribute to the final decision and are all important.  Model 1 results were also compared to the other works in the liter  ature presented in  10 20 24  where different datasets were used with  ML prediction models. The comparison confirmed that the implemented  model in this work achieved higher accuracy. Table 15 shows a com  parison between the related works and the current research in terms of  the method  performance measurements  features  geographical loca  tion  and dataset size.  The second goal of this work was to identify the features that are  most relevant to patients   need for ICU and their stay length. Therefore   the feature correlation with the number of days to discharge from the  ICU was extracted from the heatmap. Table 16 shows the top 10 features  that are highly correlated with the LoS for COVID 19 patients in Saudi  Arabia. The obtained correlation results show that age  C Reactive  Protein  nasal oxygen support days  organ dysfunction or failure  LDH   blood oxygen saturation  headache  autoimmune disease  D dimer  and  ferritin are the features that can strongly indicate the need for patients to  be in ICU. These obtained results are aligned generally with the iden  tified features relevant to ICU admission in the literature which was  presented earlier in Table 2.  6.Conclusion and future work  Artificial intelligence technologies have been widely employed in the  battle against the COVID 19 pandemic as they support medical services  with great tools to predict  monitor  track  and contain the pandemic.  This work aimed to provide a model to help in managing the medical  resources and facilitate the services for COVID 19 patients with severe  conditions. The work presented in this paper aimed first to develop a  prediction model to predict the need for COVID 19 patients to be in the  ICU and to estimate the duration in days of their stay. Four prediction  models were developed using ML classifiers  RF  GB  XGBoost  and  Ensemble as those four classifiers are known to perform well for the  targeted purpose. The developed model achieved high accuracy of  94.16  with Random Forest which provides a reliable tool to help  hospitals and healthcare providers to predict the period where the ICU Table 8  The results of predicting the number of days to discharge from ICU class for  Model 2 with feature selection.

The second goal was to find the features related  to the need for ICU for COVID 19 patients in the eastern province of  Saudi Arabia. The obtained results showed that age  CRP  nasal oxygen  support days are the top features related to the need for ICU admission  and the length of stay in the unit.  The future direction is to utilize the implemented model and the  collected data to estimate and predict the need for COVID 19 patients for  nasal oxygen support to better manage these resources. Also  the  implemented model can be used with a larger dataset collected from the  main regions of Saudi Arabia to be able to generalize the model to the  kingdom or worldwide.

Summary  Since the World Health Organization WHO declared the Coronavirus  disease 2019  COVID 19  as a pandemic in March 2020  all countries  around the world devoted their efforts and resources to contain the rapid  spread of the disease and limit its hazardous effects on individuals   lives.  One of the challenges that faces most hospitals and healthcare providers  is managing the hospital resources and identifying when these resources  will be available to serve new patients. Intensive Care Unit  ICU  beds  are of the resources that witnessed high demand during the pandemic as  COVID 19 is a respiratory disease and some patients develop compli   cations when getting affected  which requires ICU admission. This work  reviewed the published work that aimed at estimating the length of stay  in the ICU for COVID 19 patients. It has been found that no yet published  study estimated the ICU length of stay in the Saudi Arabia dataset. This  research aims at utilizing machine learning techniques to develop a  prediction model to assess the need for COVID 19 patients for ICU  admission and to estimate the number of days needed. A dataset of 895  positive COVID 19 patients at King Fahad University hospital in Dam  mam in Saudi Arabia was collected. It contained 47 clinical and de  mographics features collected at admission time  from the medical  history of the patient  and updated daily until admitted to the ICU. Data  were prepared and pre processed to be used with the models  KNN  Table 15  Comparison of obtained results with the related studies.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100937 9imputation was applied to fill in the missing data. The imbalanced data  issue was resolved by applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling  Technique  SMOTE .  Four prediction models were developed using four ML classifiers   Random Forest  RF   Gradient Boosting  GB   Extreme Gradient Boost   ing  XGBoost   and Ensemble. The dataset was split into 2 folds  80  for  training and 20  for testing. The same data was used with all models to  compare the performance. A number of experiments were conducted  with different k fold. Feature selection was applied using the Boruta  algorithm to reduce the number of features. However  using the full set  of features proved to provide higher accuracy.  The conducted experiments show that the highest accuracy could be  achieved by applying the RF model for prediction as the accuracy was  94.16  which is high accuracy compared to the other published works  for the same purpose. Feature correlation with the length of stay in ICU  was obtained  and the results showed that age  CRP  nasal oxygen sup  port days are the top indicators that are related to the patient  s need for  the ICU admission. This work hopes to pave the path for hospitals and  healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia to manage their resources to  encounter the pandemic in the best manner.
