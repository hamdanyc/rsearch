Statistically  significant differences  p D.05  between the groups were identified in relation to the impact of gig economy on  their daily life  and personal and professional development. Younger participants  Mean  4.1  SD  1.24  aged  less than 40 years reflected high impact compared to older participants  Mean  3.7  SD  1.97 . Female par  ticipants reflected more positive impact on their personal and professional development by working in Gig  Economy Framework compared to male participants.  Conclusion  Gig Economy features can address the major challenges affecting nursing workforce in Saudi Arabia   which are creating hurdles in the process of achieving Saudization and vision 2030 objectives in healthcare  specifically nursing.    1.Introduction  Gig Economy is characterized by its flexibility allowing individuals  to work independently for specific gigs or tasks provided by organiza   tions  where no formal employment mechanism is observed  instead a  contract for work is implemented. World Economic Forum defined Gig  Economy focusing on workforce participation and income generation  through gigs or tasks  for which a worker is hired  1 . Gig Economy has  been rapidly transforming the future of work  due to its unique char  acteristics of employment which seems to be having upper hand over  traditional employment in many ways. As there is no  employee employer relationships  the gig workers are not bound to any  particular employer  and has freedom to opt any employer for gigs   reflecting greater flexibility in choice of work  and also the working  hours  2 4 . Similarly  businesses employers also have greater flexi  bility as they are not dependent on set of employees for completing tasks  as a result they can get the same work done at lower costs. In  addition  they can avoid costs related to  benefits  advances  insurance  etc. which are basic elements that need to be provided in a formal  employment.  The number of gig workers is rapidly increasing across the globe.  About one in four US workers is engaged in some sort of gig work  while  one in ten US workers are having gig work as their primary source of  income  5 . The global volume of Gig Economy is expected to rise from   296.7 billion in 2020 to  455.2 billion in 2023  6   reflecting a com  pound annual growth rate of 17.4 . The number of gig workers is  rapidly increasing in the developed countries. For example  the total gig  workers in the US are expected to reach 86 million by 2027  similarly   the gig workforce doubled in the UK from 2.3 million in 2016 to 4.7  million in 2019  7 . Currently  44  of gig workers in the US are  considering gig work to be their primary income sources and over 60   of gig workers engage in gigs at least once in a week  reflecting high  E mail address  rnaldosari iau.edu.sa .

It is identified that gig economy in  India has a potential to create 90 million jobs  about 30  of non farming  Indian workforce   which accounts to 1.25  of GDP  8 .  However  Gig Economy has both advantages and disadvantages. The  advantages to the gig workers include increased flexibility in terms of  choice of work and working hours  greater independence in completing  jobs  option of variety of gigs for selection  and earn as you work  but  also has some disadvantages  such as lack of benefits  taxes and personal  expenses  isolation and lack of cultural solidarity  due to lack of office  work environment with colleagues   and increased stress. Similarly  Gig  Economy also benefits businesses  as they lower costs in operations  pay  per work   scale quickly  have access to diverse pool of flexible workers   and also have some disadvantages such as less reliable workforce  tight  regulations on contract status etc.  9 . These pros and cons for both  businesses and workers may vary based on the demand and supply  statistics. For instance  in India  due to large number of unemployed   many individuals joined gig platforms such as Uber and Ola taxi riding  applications. As the supply  workers  is more  the companies started  paying them low wages  as a result of which  the workers had to work in  longer shifts usually more than 8 h on all days in the week. Such con  ditions increase stress on the workers making them vulnerable to  side effects on health and increase risk of accidents due to restlessness.  Furthermore  these companies cannot be held liable for any adverse  events as the workers are not their employees  1 . However  such con  ditions are only limited to low skilled employment opportunities as the  supply is high. However  in professional employment contracts  the  demand is high while the supply is less  which makes the professional  gig workers to demand high pays as per the work. Therefore  in pro  fessional services  gig workers hold upper hand  while in low skilled  employment  companies hold the upper hand in taking decisions.  Adoption of Gig Economy in healthcare is one of the interesting as  pects that the future research can look forward to. Saudi Arabia for  instance  is rapidly transforming its healthcare system by adopting  innovative technologies in order to increase the sustainability and  improve the healthcare services as a part of its vision 2030 programme.  However  the country is largely dependent on expatriate workers in  healthcare system. Nurses form the largest group of healthcare pro  fessionals in Saudi Arabia  and they play an important role in managing  the healthcare operations across many hospitals. Saudi Arabia  as per  2018 has 5.5 nurses per 1000 population  which is comparatively better  considering other countries in the MENA region  10 12 . However  the  dependency on expatriate nurses has been increasing since the past few  years. There are 196 701 nurses working in Saudi Arabia in 2020  out of  which only 42.9 were Saudi nationals  and the remaining 57.1  of the  nurses were from foreign countries. With increasing number of chronic  diseases in Saudi Arabia  the demand for the nursing workforce is ex  pected to rise rapidly in the future. Although a royal decree was issued  by the government to promote Saudization policy for nursing workforce  in 1992  13 14   no significant changes in the workforce was observed in  the past two decades. There are various challenges observed affecting  the participation of Saudi nationals in the nursing workforce  which  include negative public image of nursing profession  15 16   lack of  gender segregation in nursing profession  17   lack of support from the  family for females in caring for male patients and vice versa  18   so  cially unacceptable working environments  15   long working hours   18   low wages  19   lack of professional growth  19 20  etc.  Saudi Arabia is also having a rapid increase the demand for  contractual gig work. A rapid increase in the expatriate work visas were  issues in the recent past  which is mainly based on the contractual roles.  Furthermore  abolishment of Kafala sponsorship system  expatriate visa  status is tied to the employer  who is in full control over the employment  and employee   gives expatriate workers freedom in job mobility and  independence to enter and exit the country without need for employer s  permission  21 . Studies  22 25  have investigated the opportunities to  integrate Gig Economy in Saudi Arabian healthcare system as a part of digitization  focusing mainly on eHealth services offered remotely and  also in hospitals. The applicability and benefits of gig economy was  analyzed from various perspectives and the results proved to be positive  and effective. For instance  gig economy was proved to be effective for  sustainable development in healthcare  motivation for Saudization  program  growth in economy by creating employment opportunities   22   improved access through remote services and effective healthcare  service delivery  23 25   improved doctor patients relationships  26   27  etc. However  there is a lack of research in relation to the gig  economy and healthcare in different areas  especially the policy making   legal and regulatory aspects  implementation etc. Furthermore  there are  no studies identified which focused on the application of Gig Economy in  a specific healthcare category such as nursing profession. Although there  are various gaps in research such as policy making  legal and regulatory  aspects of gig economy in healthcare  this study  specifically focuses on  investigating the applicability of Gig Economy Framework in nursing  profession in Saudi Arabia.  2.Material and methods  A cross sectional survey design was adopted in this study for col  lecting the data related to the applicability of Gig Economy Framework  in nursing profession.  2.1. Questionnaire design  The questionnaire focused on various aspects of Gig Economy  Framework in the context of nursing profession in Saudi Arabia  by  considering other influential factors. The survey questionnaire has two  parts. The first part includes seven questions about participants  de  mographic information. The second part focuses on the 15 main survey  questions. First question relates to the various challenges affecting the  participation of Saudi citizens in nursing profession analyzed from  Ref.  28 . Participants can check multiple options in relation to this  question. Questions two to nine reflects various characteristics of Gig  Economy Framework and their applicability in nursing management  adopted from Ref.  29   for which the participants opinions are  collected. Questions 10 and 11 reflects the drawbacks of Gig Economy  Framework in nursing management  and its impact on motivating Saudi  citizens is assessed. Questions 12 and 13 focuses on the feasibility of  integrating Gig Economy framework as a part of Saudization and vision  2030 program  question 14 focuses on the need for legal regulations for  implementing Gig Economy Framework in nursing profession. Ques  tions one to fourteen were rated using Likert scale ratings  1  Strongly  disagree  2  Disagree  3  Neutral  4  Agree  5  Strongly agree   for which  the maximum mean values that can be achieved is five. Question 15  focuses on how participating in Gig Economy can influence nurses  including life  personally  professionally  and financially.  For each listed item in question 15  participants can rate on the five  scale Likert ratings  1  not at all advantageous  2  Slightly advantageous   moderately advantageous  4  Advantageous  5  Highly advantageous   reflecting the advantage of gig economy  and the maximum mean values  that can be achieved is five  reflecting the highly advantageous aspect.  The reliability of the questionnaire was evaluated using the pilot study  conducted with 35 nurses. The pilot study results achieved Cronbach s  alpha greater than 0.70 for all the items  reflecting good internal reli  ability and consistency  30 . An online version of the survey was created  using Google Surveys  and a link for the survey was generated between  the period of  November 2021 Janyary 2022 .  2.2. Sampling and participants  As the survey was targeted at nurses working in Saudi Arabian  hospitals  the survey link was forwarded to HR admins of 102 hospitals  in Saudi Arabia  which included 82 public hospitals and 20 private  hospitals. Considering the total nursing work force of 196 701 in Saudi R.

After removing the  incomplete responses  379 responses were considered for the data  analysis.  2.3. Data analysis  Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20.0  and various statistical  techniques including t tests  means  and standard deviations were used.  Missing data was removed in order to avoid any bias in analyzing the  results. As the questionnaire included questions with different options   such as multiple choice options for selecting challenges  users can select  more than one challenge   rating scale for applicability of gig economy  features in healthcare  the data analysis is presented in different per  centages for representing the challenges  and mean and standard de  viations for representing the applicability and impact of gig economy in  healthcare.  2.4. Ethical considerations  Informed consent was taken from all the participants using checkbox  option before starting the survey  where the users are provided with the  information about the study. Anonymity of the participants is ensured in  this study. Ethical approval for the study was received from Ministry of  Health  Saudi Arabia.  3.Results  As shown in Table 1  majority of the participants were females   representing 66.2  of the total participants  and male participants  represented 33.8  of total participants. Majority of the participants  were qualified in Bachelor  s degree  followed by 29.8  in nursing  diploma  17.1  in master  s degree  and 3.9  in Ph.D. Majority of the  participants were aged between 40 and 49 years  followed by 31.4   aged 20 29 years  17.9  aged between 30 and 39 years  and 16.1   aged between 50 and 59 years. Majority of the participants were highly  experienced  as 45.7  were having a work experience of ten or more  years. In addition  25.1  were having three to six years of work experience followed by 22.9  having seven to nine years of work  experience  while only 6.3  were having an experience of less than  three years. About 68.9  participants were expatriate workers and  31.1  were Saudi national workers. Nurse managers represented 24.3   and staff nurses represented 75.7  of the total participants.  Table 2 shows the various challenges associated with nursing pro  fession. The major challenges identified by the participants include   difficulty in working in gender mixed environment  84.3    socio   cultural restrictions for Saudi nurses  81.2    lower wages  79.4     dissatisfaction among family members if their children or spouses cares  for opposite gender patients at hospitals  76.5    high work load   73.9    and greater dependency on expatriates  71.6  . However  all  other challenges as presented in Table 2 were identified to be important  as more than 50  of the participants recognized them.  Table 3 shows the applicability of different Gig Economy charac   teristics in nursing profession. Aspects such as flexibility of work  such  as selecting the hospital area of work as per the gig workers conve   nience   freedom of choice in work  For example  freedom in selecting  male female wards for providing services   formal contracts  no  employer employee relation   and variations in tasks  ability to change  gigs or nursing tasks from time to time  were considered to be the highly  rated characteristics of gig economy that can be applied in nursing  profession. It is interesting to note that all the characters were identified  to be very good for application in nursing profession by majority of the  participants.  In relation to the Gig Economy Framework drawback  i.e.  not having  benefits provided by the employer  hospital   majority of the partici   pants strongly disagreed  51.6   and 26.3  disagreed that it would  have negative influence on adoption of Gig Economy. only 10.2   strongly agreed and 4.6  agreed that it would have negative influence.  Similarly  considering the inconsistent incomes in Gig Economy  ma  jority of the participants disagreed  42.4   and strongly disagreed   6.7   that it would have negative impact on the adoption of Gig  Economy in nursing profession. At the same time  39.8  strongly agreed  and 6.9  agreed that it would have a negative impact on the adoption   thus reflecting the mixed results in relation to the drawback of incon   sistent income.  Focusing on Gig Economy advantages  integrating Gig Economy can  support the increase of female work force in nursing profession  one of  the objectives of Vision 2030 and Saudization  64.7  participants  strongly agreed and 11.2  agreed that it would help in increasing the  female participation in nursing profession. Integrating Gig Economy  platforms  i.e.  where nurses can be selected according to the demand in  the hospitals  can help in digitization  increasing efficiency of healthcare  operations such as resource management and improving sustainability   the important objectives of Vision 2030.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100921 4strongly agreed and 21.2  participants agreed that integration would  increase the use of ICTs in healthcare nursing management and increase  sustainability enabling Vision 2030 programme. Furthermore  70.4   participants strongly agreed and 11.6  agreed that there is a need to  develop and implement legal regulations and policies for both health   care providers and workers such as nurses for better integration of Gig  Economy Framework in nursing profession.  Table 4 shows the impact of Gig Economy on various aspects related  to nurses. It is identified that the major impact would be on personal  comfort and development  Mean  4.2   followed by professional  comfort and development  Mean  4.1   and daily life  Mean  3.9 .  However  financial management was rated slightly low  Mean  3.6   compared to other factors. To further analyze the results between the  groups  t test were carried out as shown in the Table 5  for daily life    Table 6  personal comfort and development   Table 7  professional  comfort and development   and Table 8  financial management .  In relation to the impact of participating in Gig Economy on daily  life  young participants  Mean  4.1  SD  1.24  aged less than 40 years  reflected high impact compared to older participants  Mean  3.7  SD   1.97 . No differences in opinions were observed among male and female  participants  Saudi and non Saudi nationals  and nurse managers and  staff nurses. However  all participants   groups reflected high impact on  daily lives. In relation to personal comfort and development  all the  participants reflected high impact. However  significant difference of  opinions was observed among females  Mean  4.3  SD  1.08   who  reflected more impact compared to male participants  Mean  4.0  SD   1.16 . Similarly  in relation to professional comfort and development   females  Mean  4.2  SD  1.01  reflected high impact compared to  males  Mean  3.9  SD  1.09 . While all participants reflected high  impact  no major differences were observed among other participants    groups. Furthermore  no significant difference of opinions were  observed among all participants   groups in relation to the impact on  financial management.  4.Discussion  The findings related to the challenges in nursing profession were  gender mixed environment  socio cultural restrictions for Saudi nurses   lower wages  dissatisfaction among family members if their children or  spouses cares for opposite gender patients at hospitals  high work load   and greater dependency on expatriates which are in consistent with the  findings in previous studies  15 20 . Considering these challenges  the  features of Gig Economy Framework can effectively address these  challenges. For instance   flexibility of work    which was identified to be  effective in integrating Gig Economy in nursing profession by the participants can help the nurses in selecting the work at preferred hos  pitals. This can benefit Saudi female nurses who look for jobs at nearby  hospitals  and also the expatriate nurses who can work in the hospitals of  their interest. Another feature for instance  freedom of choice in work  can enable nurses to select the wards of their respective genders. As a  result  the influence of families on nursing work can be reduced to a  greater extent. Similarly  contract based work can help the nurse to  work as per their convenience  without being controlled  making the  personal and professional lives easy. Furthermore  using the gig plat  forms  the nurses can select different shifts  different hospitals as per  their convenience  enabling more transparency and accountability to  wards their work and care. Furthermore  using these platforms  it may  be easy for nurses to opt contract based jobs which require  remote working  such as reminding medicines  tracking patients    development and progress  managing nursing records etc. These possi   bilities of gig works were discussed in general healthcare settings in  previous studies  22 25   but not in specific to nursing profession.  However  the drawbacks such as no benefits from employers and  inconsistent payments were identified to be not having major impact on  the nurses  reflecting low negative impact on the nurses   motivation  towards Gig Economy Framework. In addition  various benefits such as  increase in Saudi nursing workforce  especially women  and effective  management of nursing operations using gig platforms can enable  transparency  accountability  and security in healthcare operations   which are the few objectives of Saudization and Vision 2030 objectives  respectively. However  as the Gig Economy is emerging there are no  clear policies and regulations developed  which increases the risk for  both gig workers and businesses contracting them. Accordingly  ma  jority of the participants strongly agreed that there is a need to develop  and implement legal regulations and policies for both healthcare pro  viders and workers such as nurses for better integration of Gig Economy  Framework in nursing profession. Furthermore  there is a lack of liter  ature in this context for designing and developing policy regulations for  gig economy adoption in healthcare  and this can be addressed in future  research studies.  Finally  the impact of integrating Gig Economy in nursing profession  was identified on various fronts from the perspective of nurses. Both  professional and personal comfort and development were identified to  be the main aspects which are positively influenced. Although all as  pects were identified to be positively influenced  daily life and financial  management were rated slightly low compared to the above two factors.  Furthermore  younger participants reflected slightly more positive  impact on daily life compared to older participants. In addition  female  participants reflected more positive impact on their personal and pro  fessional development by working in Gig Economy Framework  compared to male participants  reflecting that Gig Economy Framework  effectively supports female nursing workforce in Saudi Arabia  which  can help in minimizing the impact of socio cultural restrictions in their  participation in nursing profession. Furthermore  no significant differ   ences were identified among the participants in relation to financial  management  although its impact can be observed among all the par  ticipants. Overall  all participants groups reflected similar views on the  impact of integrating Gig Economy Framework in nursing profession on  their lives. Based on the findings  it can be suggested that Gig Economy  Framework can be applied in nursing profession in Saudi Arabia  which  may contribute to the objectives of Saudization and Vision 2030  objectives.  This study has various implications. Firstly  this study addresses the  research gaps in linking the Gig Economy Framework with nursing  profession in Saudi Arabia from the context of vision 2030 and Saud  ization objectives. Secondly  the study only analyzed the applicability of  Gig Economy Framework in nursing profession  and it can guide the  future researchers in conducting similar studies in different healthcare  operations and contexts. Thirdly  the findings from this study can guide  the decision makers in defining policies that support Gig Economy  Framework in healthcare operations as a part of digitization strategy in Table 3  Gig Economy characteristics applicability in nursing profession.

However  this study has few limitations  as the  sample rate identified in this study is low  considering the total nursing  work force in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore  only survey instrument was  used  which has limited the quality of data collected and analyzed.  Adopting qualitative approaches  such as interviews would have led to  more quality data from experts in relation to the impact of integrating  gig economy in nursing profession.  5.Conclusion  This study has identified the feasibility of integrating Gig Economy  Framework in nursing profession  one of the main elements of healthcare system. The results suggested that Gig Economy features can  address the major challenges affecting nursing workforce in Saudi Ara  bia  which are creating hurdles in the process of achieving Saudization  and Vision 2030 objectives in healthcare. Although various solutions  were suggested in different studies  Gig Economy can effectively address  these challenges  and can be proved to be beneficial for both nurses and  hospitals.
