Introduction The protein complex is a group of proteins where proteins interact with each other to participate in specific biological activities  such as hemoglobin molecule is a complex of four globular protein units. In protein complex  multiple proteins are linked by non covalent bond called protein protein interactions. Protein complexes carried out many biological processes. They are responsible for transcription of DNA and translation of mRNA. The functions of unknown proteins can be pre  dicted using interactions of known proteins   1 . Prediction of protein complexes helps in understanding the protein functions   2   identifying disease genes   3   and discovering drug disease association   4 . Although biologists have discovered a large number of protein in  teractions  small protein complexes were identified by lab experiments due to experimental limitations. That is why computational methods become the useful alternatives of protein complex prediction from protein protein interactions  PPIs . Molecular biology techniques such as Yeast Two hybrid  Y2H    5  is used to discover protein protein interactions. The PPI network contains tens of thousands of protein  protein interactions. Finding the actual protein complexes from a large PPI network requires a sophisticated algorithm. In this paper  a new optimization algorithm has been developed to predict the protein complex. The algorithm uses a metaheuristic algorithm called Chemical Reaction Optimization  CRO    6  with three additional repair operators to find out the protein complex in a large Protein Protein Interaction Network  PPIN . The PPIN data can be modeled as a graph where each node represents a protein and the  Corresponding author. E mail addresses  shahid uap bd.edu  Md. Shahidul Islam   dmri1978 cseku.ac.bd  Md.

The algorithm aims to maximize the density to find the optimal clustering of PPIN. The CRO algorithm follows the behavior of chemical reactions. It has both local and global search properties. The high flexibility of designing reaction operators and variable population size are two features that help CRO to fit in any optimization problem. CRO came out publicly in 2012. Since then it has been used to solve many opti  mization problems and showed better results than other metaheuristics approaches. Cognitive radio spectrum allocation  quadratic assignment  network coding optimization   7   shortest common super sequence   8   protein structure prediction   9   and RNA structure prediction   10 11  problems were solved by CRO. In each of these problems  CRO out  performs other algorithms. The algorithm was tested on the yeast and human protein interaction data with two benchmarks. The comparison with the state of the art algorithms demonstrates the best performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy and f measure. The contribution of the work has been summarized in the list below. 1. An efficient method for protein complex discovery has been developed by hybridizing probabilistic local search  PLW  and chemical reaction optimization  CRO  algorithms. 2. The CRO operators have been redesigned. 3. Repair operators for CRO have been developed.

Predicting protein complexes of medium size  3 to 25 proteins in a complex  with higher accuracy. 2. Problem statement and objective functions Protein complex or protein protein interaction is a biological pro  cess where multiple proteins stick together by molecular bond and perform cellular functions. Protein complex prediction aims to find a group of proteins that are highly associated with each other. In graph perspective  the protein complex identification is to find the highly connected sub graphs within a given undirected graph. In the PPI network  a protein may belong to different complexes. A protein protein interaction network can be represented as an undirected graph           where is the set of proteins and   is the set of protein interactions  12 . The number of edges within a sub graph or cluster is called intra cohesion and the number of edges across clusters is called inter cluster coupling. The fitness of a protein complex depends on intra cohesion as well as inter cluster coupling. Therefore  the objective of protein complex prediction  PCP  becomes to maximize the intra cohesion and minimize the inter cluster coupling. Let us first define the necessary terms for this problem. Density of a graph  The density of an undirected graph       is defined as the number of edges  in divided by the number of edges in a complete graph with  vertices. The theoretical maximum number of edges possible for an undirected graph is           1  2. Therefore  the density of a graph G          2       1  1  Degree of a vertex  The degree of a vertex  is the number of neighboring vertices directly connected to the vertex by an edge.                                   2  Local neighborhood graph  For a vertex    its local neighbor  hood graph   is the sub graph made up of edges   connected to    and the vertices  directly connected by an edge such that          . Formally               3  Where                                                              Common neighbor similarity  CNS   The common neighbor sim  ilarity of two vertices  and is the cosine similarity of the vector representation of the vertices  neighborhoods. It is expressed as                                   4  Where        1 if            0 otherwise This is also applied for   . Two objective functions have been used here. The first one is for seed proteins selection and another is for cluster energy evaluation  see Section 4.1 . A score is used to find the core proteins as seeds of clusters. The score of a node   is defined as                                 5  We compute the density of a cluster during optimization using a modified density function. The function is expressed as follows.                    2       1    2   6 Where is the number inter cluster edges    is the number of outward edges originated in cluster    and    is the number of edges in a complete graph with same number of nodes in  . A large positive value of     indicates the good cluster. Thus  protein complex prediction is an energy maximization problem. How  ever  to maintain the compatibility with chemical reaction optimization  CRO   the density is considered as a negative quantity  i.e. in CRO algorithm energy             . 2.1. Computational complexity of PCP The objective of PCP is to find the less overlapping dense sub  graphs. More precisely  the PCP problem is corresponding to the top k overlapping densest sub graphs problem where k is not fixed. The objective of the top k overlapping densest sub graph is to maximize the following reward function  13                    1    1       1                7  Where        1     2          is a set of k sub graphs  with 1      and     1    . The is a distance function.                 2       2        if    0  otherwise Here is a parameter with    0which dominates the amount of overlaps between sub graphs. When  is small  the sub graphs share a significant overlaps. On the other hand  if  is large  then the sub  graphs share a few or no vertices and the sub graphs may be disjoint. For top 3 overlapping densest sub graph    3   3 13 . The top k overlapping densest sub graphs is proven NP hard by a reduction from the 3 clique partition which is proved as NP complete  14 . The 3  clique partition is NP complete and a polynomial time reduction of it is known. Therefore  finding any top k overlapping densest sub graph with     3 is NP hard  13 15 . Hence  the PCP problem is also NP hard. 3. Literature survey In past decades  based on graph clustering methods several algo  rithms were developed for protein complex prediction. Many algo  rithms directly apply the clustering algorithm with some modification  some mixed with probability and heuristic. Protein complex detection algorithms mainly divided into two categories  16 .  A  Network based  1  Divisive approach  2  Agglomerative approach  B  Biological context aware based  1  Core attachment approach  2  Functional or Evolutionary Information based 3.1. Network based PCP The network based approaches first convert the PPI network as an undirected graph and apply graph clustering algorithms to discover the protein complexes.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100947 3Md. Shahidul Islam et al. 3.1.1. Divisive The network based divisive methods use graph clustering algo  rithms to divide the PPI network into some dense sub graphs. The sub graphs are represented as protein complexes. First  the algorithms score the vertices using neighborhood density and select the nodes with higher scores as seed points. Different functions are used in neighbor  hood density evaluation such as min max cut  ratio cut  normalize cut  density  etc. A threshold is used in filtering the top scoring nodes. Then a clustering algorithm  e.g. k means clustering  is applied for finding dense sub graphs for each seed node. Additional post processing such as removing duplicate proteins and removing clusters less than three nodes are required before producing the final results. Depending on the clustering algorithm  the clusters may overlap or may not overlap. Ramadan et al. developed a network based divisive algorithm  17  based on the genetic algorithm. The Core Peel  18  method uses a core decomposition and filtering lower degree nodes instead of selecting the top nodes. Elahe et al.  19  developed a DeepWalk  20  based algorithm for link prediction in PPI networks. The algorithm extracts the feature of nodes and calculates similarity between two features using Pearson similarity criterion. After that the features are divided into cluster based on similarity. Then the most effective features are selected. The word2vec  21  model is applied on the selected features and find the embedding vectors for each node. Finally  the vectors and their corre  sponding labels are used for predicting protein protein interactions. A modified version of the DeepWalk algorithm was developed by Kamal et al.  22  where random walk algorithm was used instead of feature selection. Both the algorithms show better accuracy and f measure than the previous algorithms and are able to predict new interactions effectively. A major disadvantage of divisive approaches is the lack of accuracy due to skipping the biological information. 3.1.2. Agglomerative Agglomerative methods start with finding the seed nodes and then expand the neighborhood sub graph of the seeds. The sub graphs are evaluated using an objective function. Thus a seed node grows into a cluster. Agglomerative methods are executed in three main steps. Firstly  it scores each node  protein  in the graph using the neigh  borhood density function and keeps the nodes with the higher score as seeds. Secondly  the algorithm finds the neighboring nodes  whose scores are above a threshold value  of a seed node to expand the seed node to a sub graph. Once there are no vertices left to be added the algorithm stops and repeats with the next highest scoring seed. Finally  when there are no seed nodes left  the clustering process stops. Additional post processing is performed before complexes are scored and ranked. The MCODE  23  algorithm is among the first methods to detect protein complexes. It does not consider overlapping clusters  hence a node is not included in more than one cluster. The ClusterONE  24  algorithm allows overlapping the protein clusters if the overlap score  neighborhood affinity  Eq.  9   is below 0.8. The complexes with overlapping score above 0.8 are merged recursively. The SR MCL  25   LF PIN  26   GenEx  27  and CPNM  28  are examples of the network  based agglomerative approach. 3.2. Biological context aware PCP Graph based PCP algorithms lack the accuracy of prediction in PPI networks because the PPI complexes are extracted from dense clusters without biological context. Moreover  protein complexes have special properties such as two protein complexes can overlap each other and the average complex size in the yeast protein dataset is 10 15. Biological context aware based methods enjoy the benefits of biolog  ical heuristics such as Gene Ontology  GO  annotations. Therefore  biological context aware based methods have higher accuracy and f  measure than naive graph based algorithms. Biological context aware PCP can be divided into two categories core attachment approach and evolutionary information based approach.3.2.1. Core attachment methods The core attachment methods work in two phases. First  it extracts the core proteins from a PPI network. A core protein is the heart of a protein complex that interacts with many proteins. Then it attaches the neighboring proteins to the core proteins to form the complex. During the core extraction and attachment process  it uses heuristics or functions that help to achieve a more accurate complex. The success of the core attachment methods mostly relies on finding the core proteins. The different algorithm use various technologies to extract the core proteins. The Probabilistic Local Walks  PLW  algorithm  proposed by Wong et al.  29   defined a scoring function of the vertices as the product of the degree of a vertex and the density of its sub graph. The top 30  vertices are considered as core proteins. Such a scoring function has two major advantages. Between two proteins with the same sub graphs density but different degree  the protein with the higher degree is more likely to be selected as core protein. On the other side  two proteins with the same degree but different densities  the protein with higher sub graph density tends to be selected as seed protein. Therefore  a balanced measure between degree and density helps to select the optimal seed proteins. Furthermore  the PLW algorithm breaks the attachment process into two steps  expansion of core proteins into core complexes and expansion of core complexes into the final protein complexes. A local walk algorithm is employed to visit neighboring nodes of each seed node. The frequency of visiting nodes from a seed node is counted and z score is computed for non zero frequencies. With a significance level of 0.5   proteins are chosen to find protein complex cores. The proteins that interact with more than half of the proteins of a complex core are selected as attachment. COACH  30   IPC MCE  31   DCU  32   WPNCA  33   CFOCM  34   DCA  35  and BHHO  36  follow the core attachment technique to identify protein complexes. 3.2.2. Functional or evolutionary information based methods Evolutionary Information based methods use heuristics or intel  ligent functions that match with hand cut protein data. Using the training outcomes  the algorithm finds a way to explore the unknown PPI networks and extract meaningful protein complexes. RNSC  37   Restricted Neighborhood Search Clustering  algorithm uses Gene On  tology  GO  annotation to detect meaningful protein complexes. The algorithm finds the complexes using network based clustering and filters the complexes based on cluster properties and functional homo  geneity. Using GO annotations  a   value of the predicted complexes is calculated. The complexes below a threshold value are kept as final complexes. 4. Chemical Reaction Optimization for protein complex prediction Chemical Reaction Optimization  CRO  is a population based meta  heuristic algorithm influenced by the nature of chemical reactions  6  7 . The CRO algorithm takes over the characteristics of the chemical reactions to solve the optimization problems. In CRO  molecular energy is two types  potential energy       and kinetic energy      . Potential energy is the fitness function value of the corresponding solution  i.e.     in this problem. Kinetic energy refers to the tolerance of a system to accept a worse solution. The energy of the surroundings is stored in the buffer. The number of collisions are recorded as        in CRO. There are three steps in execution of CRO initialization  iteration  and termination. In initialization stage  CRO initializes the param  eters and generates initial population. In this phase  the algorithm analyzes the solution space through the elementary reaction oper  ators. The change of molecule from its unstable state to a stable state is brought forth by a collision. Collisions are two types  such as uni molecular and inter molecular collisions. Out of four basic opera  tors  on wall ineffective collision and decomposition are contained in

The other two  inter molecular ineffective collision and synthesis are in the inter molecular collision. The detail about CRO and its properties can be found in   7 38 . We call our designed method PCP CRO  Protein Complex Prediction using Chemical Reaction Optimization . Parameters of PCP CRO algorithm are listed in Table 1. 4.1. Initialization Initially  a unique integer number is assigned to each individual protein. An undirected graph  is constructed from the protein inter  action data. Adjacency matrix  represents the graph  . The score is calculated incrementally for all nodes. Then the proteins are ranked by the score and a fraction is taken into seed vector    as seed proteins. For this paper  top 30  of the proteins are selected as seed proteins. The population generation process includes searching of core proteins and extraction of core complex. For each seed vertex  in   seed clusters are calculated by exploring the neighborhood graph of  . Seed clusters are then fed into the CRO algorithm for optimization. The probabilistic local walk  PLW    29  is employed to find the seed clusters. The PLW initialized with a initial energy and a seed vertex from  . The algorithm iterates  times for each seed vertex unless the energy falls below 0. It walks from the seed vertex to its neighboring vertex using probability. The probability of randomly selecting a node connected to u is given in Eq.  8 .                                   8  The local walk is bound up to second level neighbors. Each time a node is visited except the seed nodes  the frequency of the node is increment by one. Once the walk is completed for all nodes in    the         of the non zero frequencies is calculated.                Here  is the observed value  frequency of visiting nodes    is the mean of the sample  and  is the standard deviation of the sample. Then the significant nodes are attached to the core proteins to make core complexes. The core complexes are filtered out for any duplicate of complex size less than 3. Each core complex in the output of the PLW algorithm is considered as a molecule  in CRO. 4.2. Operator design The CRO algorithm has four elementary reaction operators. These operators are remodeled to adopt the PCP problem. In this experiment  only three of them are used namely On wall ineffective collision  decomposition  inter molecular ineffective collision. The synthesis op  erator has been disabled. In this work  the reason for choosing operators and how they contribute are described in Section 4.3  Execution . The description of the operators used in PCP CRO is given below. The figures related to the operators are drawn based on an example PPI network shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. A graph representing a sample PPI network. Fig. 2. On wall ineffective collision. 4.2.1. On wall ineffective collision In this reaction  the molecular structure remains almost identical except with a little change in it. This operator is used for neighborhood search. A random position  is considered in the molecule. The initial molecule contains the id of the protein in the seed cluster. The values of th position is replaced by a random node that is connected to  th value. Thus a single position in the molecule changes and creates a new individual that helps to find the neighbor solution on the spaces. During the on wall ineffective collision  other indices of the molecule remain same in the new molecule. Fig. 2 shows the on wall ineffective collision process. 4.2.2. Decomposition A relevant change comes to the structures of the new molecules in decomposition. It diversifies the molecules and digs into the other area of search space. This operator is very useful in a situation when the algorithm is stuck into local maximum. In this problem  a molecule breaks into two equal parts. A new molecule gets the first part of the molecule and other half is filled randomly  shown in Fig. 3 . Using the last part of the molecule  another new molecule is produced where the first half is picked randomly. The randomly generated parts are filled with neighboring nodes of the old part. The reaction creates two molecules at most half structure is different from the previous molecule.

Inter molecular ineffective collision The number of molecules does not change after the inter molecular ineffective collision. Although the reaction fails to bring out new molecules it changes the acting molecules itself. The inter molecular ineffective collision employs in local search. Two molecules e.g.  1 and 2are taken from the population such that they have overlapping proteins. After the reaction two new molecules  3and 4are produced  shown in Fig. 4 . Each node of the overlapping indices of both molecules is replaced by a random node connected to the indexed node. The none overlapping nodes remain unchanged in both molecules. This exchange brings changes to new solutions. 4.2.4. Repair operators A repair operator is an important operator that removes weakness or repairs damage and helps to improve the quality of the molecule. It can work during execution or after completing the execution of the algorithm. In this method we have used three repair operators. They are                         and                    . The              operator is used for removing redundant proteins. The bridge operator unites the scattered complexes after the decomposition operation and the repair tiny cluster operator deals with the complex of very few proteins. Concentration. CRO operators create some redundant nodes into the molecule. In the protein complex  there should not be any duplicate protein. So  a repair operator named               is used to filter out the duplicate nodes. Moreover  if a duplicate node is truly positive  it counted once  and twice if it is a false positive. Therefore  it reduces the PPV  positive predictive value . A linear search algorithm is applied to search the duplicates. The outcome of the concentration operator  applied to the  2 Fig. 3  produced by decomposition  is shown in Fig. 5. Bridge. First  the isolated proteins are discovered in the molecule. For each isolated protein  if there is any second level neighbor in the molecule  i.e. local first level neighbor s neighbor  then the common first level neighbor inserted into the molecule. Say A B and A C are directly connected. Therefore  A is the common neighbor of both B and C. Where B and C are second level neighbor to each other. If no such protein is found  the isolated protein is removed from the molecule. The output of the concentration operator  applied to the  3 Fig. 3  produced by decomposition  is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 5. Concentration. Fig. 6. Bridge. Repair tiny cluster. Clusters with fewer proteins are called tiny clusters. Tiny cluster either should be merged with the nearest cluster or re  moved from the output clusters. First  the tiny clusters in a molecule   are detected. If the proteins in a tiny cluster have any interaction with any other cluster  then it is merged with that clusters. If the proteins in a tiny cluster have no interaction with other large clusters  then it is removed from the population space. 4.3. Execution The flowchart in Fig. 7 shows the execution stages of PCP CRO algorithm. The algorithm starts with the parameter initialization. The second phase of the CRO algorithm is the iteration. For each iteration  only one reaction can take place. A random variable  is used to decide the reaction type probabilistically. If                then the reaction will be uni molecular hence a single molecule from the population is selected. Otherwise  the reaction will be inter molecular and two molecules are selected randomly. In the uni molecular reaction state  if the       exceeds the summation of        and the parameter    then decomposition reaction will occur. Contrariwise  it will be an on wall ineffective reaction. On the other hand  if the reaction type is inter molecular and the molecules have overlap then inter molecular ineffective collision will take place. After each decomposition operation  the bridge operation is re  quired to connect the vertices inside the new molecule. If the molecule is already connected  the bridge operator has no effect on it. In case the bridge operator fails to meet the criteria the decomposition will be rejected. Bridge operation is time consuming and uncertain. Therefore 

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100947 6Md. Shahidul Islam et al. Fig. 7. Flowchart of PCP CRO. the decomposition operation is narrowed by setting a large value for  . If the inter molecular reaction is selected  however  no two overlapping molecules are found  then no reaction takes place in that iteration. To avoid a huge waste of iteration the number of inter molecular reactions is also restricted. This is described in Section 4.4  Parameter Tuning  in detail. After one of these reactions occurs  the concentration operator removes the duplicate vertices from the new molecule. The energy of the newly generated altered molecule s  is calculated again and the al  gorithm searches for the new minimum. Until the stopping criteria met the iteration goes on and finally outputs the overall minimum. Before writing the final cluster the repair tiny cluster operator is applied to filter out the small clusters. The synthesis operator has been excluded for several reasons. First of all  multipoint or uniform synthesis is not possible because it spread out the parent clusters. Although the bridge operator joins the clusters for decomposition  it is not feasible even for a single point synthesis. Secondly  a successful synthesis operation contains massive duplicate proteins. After filtering the duplicates using the concentration operator  the new molecule looks identical to a part of the parent molecule. Hence  no diverseness brings to the new molecule.4.4. Parameter tuning The experiment on parameter tuning was done with a social net  work dataset named SW 100 6 0D3 TRIAL3. It contained 100 nodes and 300 edges. The density of the network is 0.0606. The dataset was obtained from   39 . The quality of predicted clusters are measured with the density  Eq.  6  . A higher value of density indicates the better performance of an algorithm. So  we tuned the parameters to achieve a higher density. Initially  the parameter values are set randomly based on assump  tion. With the initial values of the PCP CRO parameters  we try to understand the behavior and later on we experiment by tuning the                                               and       and observe the effect of them on the average density of the predicted clusters. The searching for optimal parameter value starts with the initial parameter values given in Table 2. Once the best value is found for a parameter  it used in the next parameter value searching  i.e. updated the parameter table with the current best parameter values. With the initial value of   1  the decomposition creates a huge overlapping molecules. Additionally the bridge operator increases the execution time. So  the value of  is increased in order to reduce

Parameter tuning for          vs. average modularity of the complexes. Table 2 Parameters values of PCP CRO.

The  value was tuning in  1  50  and the best value was 30. While changing    other parameters were fixed. Fig. 8 shows the effect of changes in  on average density of the predicted clusters. The         value was initially set to 0.33 to balance between uni molecular and inter molecular reactions. Since two operators of uni molecular and one of the inter molecular reaction are used in PCP  CRO  each reaction operator shares 1 3 of the total reactions. However  the experiment shows that a large number of inter molecular reactions do not occur due to the failure to satisfy the overlapping condition. Finally  the optimal value for          found is 0.05 that allows the necessary amount of hits in uni molecular and inter molecular reactions rather than the balanced iteration concept. The other parameter valueswere fixed while changing          . The         parameter tuning is shown in Fig. 9. The   of a new molecule depends on a parameter                 1 . Here  1    determines the amount of energy goes to buffer for each on wall ineffective collision. If   of a molecule is very large  and the condition is satisfied                   then it is possible that            . That will allow us to accept a worse solution after an on wall ineffective collision. The            is tested in  0.1  0.35  and the best value is set to 0.2. Fig. 10 shows the tuning effect of           on average modularity of the complexes. The        was initially set to 10 and tested in  1  100 . The experiment shows that the large value of         takes more iteration but produces the same result. From the result obtained we observed that        did not have any effect on this problem. Other param  eters were unchanged during         alteration. While all the other parameters were set to the optimal values  the number of           is gradually increased. At 10 00 000 it is found that the results were not improving anymore. The           parameter tuning is shown in Fig. 11. 5. Experimental results analysis In this section  we present experimental datasets and evaluation metrics  followed by biological information used in PCP CRO  and the results of PCP CRO as well as comparison with some of the state of the  art algorithms.

The repair tiny cluster threshold value is set to 3. Therefore  the predicted complexes contain three or more proteins. 5.1. Datasets Two yeasts and a human PPI datasets were used for the exper  iment in this work. The first yeast dataset was retrieved from the Database of Interacting Proteins  DIP    40 . It contains 4 930 proteins and 17 201 protein protein interactions. The other one is the COM  BINED6 dataset. It is a combined dataset of the six experiments hence named as   COMBINED6  . The COMBINED6 dataset was compiled and used in PLW   29 . The dataset contains 3 861 proteins and 17 327 interactions after removing the self loops and duplicate edges. The BioGRID  human PPI  dataset was retrieved from   41 . It contains 5640 proteins and 59748 interactions after removing the self loops and duplicated edges. The CYC2008   42  and NewMIPS   43  protein complexes were used as benchmarks to validate the predicted protein complexes. 5.1.1. Information used in the PCP CRO about datasets The following information about the PPIN dataset is found by statistical analysis and provided to the PCP CRO algorithm.1. The minimum and maximum protein complex sizes are 3 and 25. A complex must contain 3 or more proteins and complexes with more than 25 proteins are uncommon in the used datasets. 2. The average protein complex size is 15. 3. Complexes with more than 50  common neighbor similarity are merged. The complexes are merged recursively. 5.2. Experimental setup The algorithm was implemented in Python  version 3.6.2  program  ming language and running on a Dell Desktop PC with Intel Core i7 CPU   3.4 GHz  16 GB RAM and Ubuntu operating system. 5.3. Evaluation metrics The well known evaluation metrics such as                    ac  curacy        sensitivity      predictive positive value         and           were used to compare the PCP CRO algorithm with existing algorithms. Let P be the set of predicted complexes and B be the set of bench  mark complexes. The neighborhood affinity score       is used to measure the amount of overlap between a predicted complex     and the benchmark complex      denoted as        in Eq.  9 . A

Therefore  it is proven that the PCP CRO takes the advantages of PLW algorithm and makes better output. The CPNM has the 2nd highest f measure . However  its accuracy is the lowest among the compared methods. The PCP CRO achieves the highest accuracy and f measure in DIP  NewMIPS comparison too as shown in Table 4. The SR MCL algorithm has the second highest accuracy while having the lowest f measure of the comparison. The reason of such results of SR MCL is predicting a huge number of clusters. As the number of proteins increases in a cluster  it is more likely to include all the proteins  true positive . It also includes proteins  false positive  which are actually not in the cluster . In this way  the accuracy increases even then the f measure gets decreased. In the COMBINED6 dataset  PCP CRO has the highest accuracy with the CYC2008 benchmark  Table 5  and the highest f measure with the NewMIPS benchmark  Table 6 . The authors of SR MCL tried to obtain accuracy without taking care of the f measure . On the other side  the CPNM was used to gain more f measure without giving importance of accuracy . However  the performance of PCP CRO is higher or very close to the highest results. In the BioGRID dataset  PCP CRO has the highest accuracy and f measure with the CYC2008 benchmark  Table 7  and the highest f  measure with the NewMIPS benchmark  Table 8 . The accuracy of PCR CRO is very close to the highest accuracy of ClusterONE with NewMIPS benchmark. Tables of Exp category I show that the PCP CRO achieved the highest accuracy compared to the other algorithms in four out of six combinations of the three PPI datasets and the two benchmarks for protein complexes. PCP CRO predicts the protein clusters in a balancedTable 15 Execution time comparison.

This leads theaccuracy andf measure to a higher value than the other algorithms. The balanced measure of sensitivity and PPV indicates that the algo  rithm predicts less false positives while trying to maximize the true positives. The balanced precision and recall indicates the harmony of the predicted cluster and benchmark cluster. The PCP CRO laggings in 2.4  in f measure in COMBINED6 CYC2008 comparison  Table 5   1.7  in accuracy in COMBINED6 NewMIPS comparison  Table 6  and 1.4  in accuracy in BioGRID NewMIPS comparison  Table 8 . Tables 9  10  11  12  13  and 14  Exp category II  shows that the SR MCL algorithm predicts a large number of clusters  3879 in DIP  2608 in COMBINED6 . It predicts 1202 proteins in DIP CYC2008  2585 proteins in DIP NewMIPS  1253 proteins in COMBINED6 CYC2008  and 2708 proteins in COMBINED6 NewMIPS. Hence it predicts most of the proteins in the benchmark. On the opposite side  the CPNM predicts an insufficient number of protein clusters. Therefore  the size of a complex get huge. PCP CRO covers most of the proteins in the dataset with a medium number of clusters  455 to 661 clusters . The algorithms that predict large complexes with many proteins contain many false positives and the complexes are almost identical. Large complex size may cover more proteins in the benchmark but it reduces the precision because of a lower ratio of      . Lower neighborhood affinity also causes a poor value of   which tends to the poor prediction recall . 5.5. Execution time comparison The execution time of the PCP CRO is compared with two recently published algorithms  CPNM  2020  and  GenEx  2017 . The execu  tion time of the algorithms was evaluated on the environment described in Section 5.2. The execution time includes pre processing  complex detection  and post processing. The GenEx and CPNM were executed with the authors  recommended configurations. The execution time comparison of PCP CRO and recent algorithms for DIP  COMBINED6 and BioGRID datasets is shown in Table 15. PCP CRO algorithm obtains less running time in all the mentioned datasets. 6. Conclusions In this paper  an optimization algorithm was used to predict protein complexes from PPI networks. The biological context aware based core  attachment technique was applied in population generation and density maximization during the optimization. The experimental result analysis shows the PCP CRO has achieved higher          than existing meth  ods. The PCP CRO extracts the dense complexes precisely by reducing false positives. Designing of the operators was a big challenge of the implementation of PCP CRO. Measuring the validity  appropriateness  and effectiveness of the operators were the other challenges. The redesigned CRO operators help to achieve the highest          in this problem. The repair operators contribute to reducing false positives and including true positives. It also legitimizes the output of CRO operators. Moreover  the algorithm was trained by parameter tuning in a variety of ranges. The number of output clusters is not fixed. The PCP CRO algorithm efficiently finds the right number of clusters without any external parameter.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100947 11Md. Shahidul Islam et al. To get the best output  given optimal parameter values   Table 2  should be used. The bridge operator is a costly function. In future  we will design PCP CRO operators in a way so that the algorithm depends less on the repair operators. The PCP CRO algorithm is best suited for predicting medium sized clusters. The operators will be designed in a better way for predicting larger protein complexes.
