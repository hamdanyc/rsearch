The prognosis for BD patients remains poor because of  the lack of reliable biomarkers and also pathogenesis and diagnostic methods remain limited. The purpose of this  study was the elucidation potential candidate hub miRNAs related to BD. We searched the gene and miRNA  expression patterns of BD from five expression arrays  GSE74358  GSE69486  GSE12654  GSE46416 for gene  expression  and GSE152267 for miRNA expression  from the Gene Expression Omnibus  GEO  database to  recognize differentially expressed genes  DEGs  and differentially expressed miRNAs  DEMs  between normal  and BD samples. Using limma package  87 DEGs were identified and Enrichment analysis for identified genes was  performed. Due to more validation of DEGs  their expression was evaluated by 8 independent expression arrays  including GSE12649  GSE23848  GSE39653  GSE46449  GSE5388  GSE5389  GSE53987  and GSE62191. By  merging DEMs and DEGs  miRNA mRNA network was constructed. After elucidation of hub miRNAs  the ability  of detected miRNAs to discriminate BD from healthy controls was assessed by area under the curve  AUC  using  the ROC curve analysis. Furthermore  RT qPCR on 50 BD samples and 50 healthy controls was performed to  validate the in silico results. Our results showed that hsa miR 19b 3p and hsa miR 23b 3P could be potential  biomarkers of BD.    1.Introduction  Non coding RNAs comprise a large proportion of human tran  scriptome mainly with no known encoded protein  however  they have  been found to play essential roles in regulation of cellular functions such  as cell cycle and proliferation  1 . Moreover  microRNAs  miRNAs   long  non coding RNAs  lncRNAs   and circular RNAs  circRNAs  are the main  classes of ncRNAs with have been associated with several human dis  eases particularly various types of cancer and therefore  suggested as  potential biomarkers with applications in diagnosis  prediction of  prognosis  and treatment  2 . MiRNAs have shown expression dysre   gulation with potential applications in psychiatric disorders like  schizophrenia  3 . Also  studies in postmortem brain tissues and in the periphery of BD patients also have shown changed expression of miRNAs  such as miR 34a and miR 137 in addition to possibility of  miRNAs encoding genes in susceptibility to BD  4 . In another study   Maffioletti et al.  5  assessed the expression level of more than 1700  miRNAs in blood samples of patients with mood disorders through a  microarray technique. They showed aberrant expression of 5 miRNAs in  blood of 20 BD patients in addition to altered expression of 5 others in  manic depressive patients. Furthermore  Camkurt et al.  6  demon   strated upregulation of 4 miRNAs in blood samples of BD patients  7  others with higher upregulation in manic BD patients  and a couple in  manic patients. They suggested miR 106a 5p and miR 107 as selective  putative biomarkers for manic BD patients.  Bipolar disorder  BD   also known as manic depressive illness  is an   Corresponding author.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100959 2affective disorder among the most distinct psychiatric illnesses charac   terized by manic depressive fluctuations in mood state and responsible  for a considerable proportion of disabilities ranking 17th among all  diseases globally  7 8 . This disorder tends to a severe and chronic  illness with recurrent episodes  with significant morbidity  poor out  comes  and also higher mortality compared to the general population   9 . The prevalence of BD among the population is yearly 2   and sui  cide and comorbidities mainly lead to the premature mortality and  reduced life expectancy among the affected patients  10 12 . The dis  tinguishing manifestation of BD is relapsing episodes of mania hypo   mania occasionally replaced by episodes of depression  which along  with other clinical symptoms including grandiosity  overconfidence   talkativeness  and changes in eating and sleeping habits constitute the  basics of disorder diagnosis  10 . Since diagnosis of the disorder   although not easy  is based on clinical presentations according to the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  DSM IV TR   guidelines  13   which means that BD is diagnosed when the manifes   tations of the disease have appeared  and so clinical management re  quires early diagnosis prior to disease. The current DSM has different  major weakness such as  Cultural Bias . DSMs are mainly published by  anglo Americans and most of the behaviour that is considered as   normal   in the DSM is actually what is considered normal by the  anglo Americans. That is  some of the behaviour that is considered as  abnormal in the DSM might be considered as normal in other cultures.  Another weakness would be that DSM promotes a mechanical approach  to mental disorder assessment. The clinicians may focus excessively on  the signs and symptoms of mental disorders and they might not put  much emphasis on a more in depth understanding of the clients patients  problems. Another weakness and debate about the DSM is that it is an  unscientific system and it is the opinion of a few powerful psychiatrists.  There are many other weaknesses with specific disorders of DSM espe  cially about the diagnosis criteria and some other issues such as whether   Paraphilias   should be included or not  14 . Currently  no neuro   imaging method or laboratory test is available for helping early diag  nosis of BD patients  15 . Family and molecular genetic studies provide  convincing evidence that BD is a multifactorial disorder  with genetic  and environmental factors contributing to its development. On the basis  of twin and family studies  the heritability of BD is estimated at 60 85 .  Genome wide association studies  GWASs  have led to valuable insights  into the genetic etiology of BD. The largest such study has been con  ducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium  PGC   in which  genome wide SNP data from 29 764 patients with BD and 169 118  controls were analyzed and 30 genome wide significant loci were  identified  PGC2   16   Thus  precise medicine is expected to help  development of biomarkers with potentials of differentiating BD pa  tients or susceptible individuals from healthy people  which accordingly  can benefit the early diagnosis of the disorder  15 .  Although previous studies have searched the role of miRNAs on BD   almost none of them considered high throughput data and also useful  packages like limma for the identification of miRNA biomarkers. Bio  informatic tools have facilitated estimation of selective miRNAs  while  extensively used high throughput RNA sequencing has helped identifi   cation of a huge number of miRNAs with putative biological importance  and potential applications in diagnosis and management of human dis  eases  17 . In this study  we aimed to evaluate the expression levels and  diagnostic values of miRNAs using in situ tools and validation via  experimental analyses in blood samples of BD patients. Accordingly  the  results can be used in development of biomarkers with applications for  easy and quick detection of BD susceptible individuals.  2.Materials and methods  2.1. Acquisition of high throughput sequencing data and pre processing  The Gene expression omnibus  GEO  database  http   www.ncbi.  nlm.nih.gov geo    was used for downloading raw data of bipolar and healthy controls. By searching keywords  bipolar and healthy controls   four gene expression arrays including GSE74358  GSE69486   GSE12654  GSE46416 and one miRNA array  GSE152267  were identi   fied. We also extracted raw data of eight expression arrays including  GSE12649  GSE23848  GSE39653  GSE46449  GSE5388  GSE5389   GSE53987  and GSE62191 for more validation of results. In GSE74358   28 samples  14 BP and 14 healthy controls expression arrays were  analyzed. In GSE69486  total RNA obtained from skin fibroblast cells of  5 healthy control samples that were pooled into 2 samples and from 10  bipolar disorder patients  in order to compare their gene expression  profiles. 15 healthy controls and 11 BP samples of GSE12654 from  postmortem brains obtained from the Stanley Medical Research Institute  were used for DNA microarray analysis. GSE46416 compare the gene  expression values of 10 healthy controls and 22 BP samples. In  GSE152267  Peripheral blood samples of 7 BD patients and 6 healthy  individuals were collected for the miRNA extraction and hybridization  on Affymetrix microarrays. The information of eight validation data is  collected in Table 1. In general DEGs between 240 control subjects and  260 BP samples were used for identification of molecular mechanism  during BP.  2.2. Data pre processing  quality control and identification of  differentially expressed genes  To normalize the selected datasets  the quantile normalization  method in the limma package  18  and also the log2 transformation  scale were used. Since each gene may have several probes  for better  results  the aggregate function of the S4Vectors package was used to  measure the average expression of all probes related to each gene. There  were significant differences in gene expression levels between patients  with mental illness and those with other diseases like tumors. For  example  if we chose the screening criteria for DEGs of tumor diseases as   log fold change  log FC   F1 or 2  even 0.2 to 0.9  there were only  approximately 10 DEGs that could be screened out for mental diseases.  To avoid missing more valuable DEGs  we artificially defined P D0.05  and  log FC F0.5 as inclusion criteria for DEGs. The differentially  expressed genes were identified using Limma package  19 .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100959 42.3. Protein  protein interactions  PPI  network analysis  Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes  STRING v.11   online tool was used to evaluate the functional interactions of DEGs  htt  ps   string db.org   . The DEGs were uploaded in the STRING tool. The  identified network was imported to Cytoscape  version 3.8.0  for further  analysis and PPI network visualization.  2.4. GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis  In the next step  DEGs were studied using Gene Ontology  GO   enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes  KEGG   pathway via ClueGO  20 . The p value D0.05 was defined as a mean   ingful enrichment analysis result. Potential functions were predicted  using GO and KEGG pathway analysis.  2.5. Validation of DEGs by independent datasets  Previously published data sets including GSE12649  GSE23848   GSE39653  GSE46449  GSE5388  GSE5389  GSE53987  and GSE62191  were downloaded and normalized and the expression values of DEGs  was evaluated by these datasets.  2.6. Screening the differentially expressed miRNAs  The limma package was used for differential expression analysis for  both BD patients and healthy individuals   samples. MiRNAs with the  FDR D0.05 and  LogFC   1 were considered differentially expressed  miRNAs  DEMs .  2.7. Construction of miRNA mRNA network  The identified DEMs in addition to highly significant genes achieved  in previous section were employed for constructing the miRNA mRNA  network. Accordingly  we applied the CyTargetLinker app of Cyto  scape  21   and then constructed a miRNA gene regulatory network via  employing three miRNA based web servers including miRBase  22    TargetScan  23   and TransmiR  24 . Based on the results retrieved from  the network  2 miRNAs were screened as the hub miRNAs.  2.8. Validation of the hub miRNAs  For further validation of the identified DEMs  we aimed demonstrate the diagnostic power of the hub miRNAs through plotting the receiver  operating characteristic  ROC  curve and estimation of the area under  the curve  AUC  using GSE152267.  2.9. Hub miRNAs qRT PCR validation  To validate the in situ results  we performed quantitative reverse   transcription PCR  qRT PCR  to analyze the genes and miRNAs expres   sion in whole blood collected from the BD patients  n  50  enrolled in  Tabriz University of Medical Sciences  Tabriz  Iran. All patients were  requested to fill the informed consent regarding the study.  2.10. RNA extraction and cDNA production  For each patient  total RNA was extracted from a 2 ml venous blood  specimen using purification kit  Qiagen Cat. No. 52304 . Then  syn  thesizing complementary DNA  cDNA  was performed  followed by  removing the genomic DNA by treating the generated cDNA with DNase  I. The extracted cDNA was purity checked using UV spectrophotometry  and handled for carrying out qRT PCR.  2.11. Primer design  To design the forward and reverse primers  we used the web based  miRNA primer designing tool  25 .  2.12. qRT PCR  The primers  which were received as lyophilized powder  Cinaclone   Iran   were prepared by adding sterile distilled water to the tubes ac  cording to the data provided by the company and then stored at  20  C.  To analyze the expression changes in both miRNAs and mRNAs  real   time PCR thermocycler  Applied Biosystems  and SYBR green qRT   PCR kit  Takara  China  were employed. Negative controls were  applied in all reactions to reveal possible contaminations. Changes in the  threshold cycle  CT   as the formula below  was used to evaluate the  expression fold alterations of the miRNAs and genes  while 5s rRNA  considered the reference to whom the expression levels of the examined  genes were compared.

MRNA miRNA network construction  Relying on the identified DEMs and the DEGs  construction of a  miRNA mRNA network was conducted  Fig. 6 . As obvious  the hsa miR   19b 3p and hsa miR 23b 3P show direct effect on highest number of  DEGs and are considered hub miRNAs.  3.6. Validation of the hub miRNAs by the ROC curve  Plotting the ROC curves was conducted according to the GSE152267  raw data and through a single gene test. This was carried out by  assigning the sensitivity and specificity values estimated for differenti   ating the BD patients   samples from healthy controls to each side of the  curve for two hub miRNAs. The Hanley and McNeil test  26  was  employed for comparing the AUC in ROC curves  Fig. 7 . The results demonstrated significant values for both miRNAs as AUC of 1  and  p value of 0.0027 for hsa miR 19b 3p  and AUC of 0.8  and p value of  0.0433 for hsa miR 23b 3P.  3.7. qRT PCR  Expression of the selected miRNAs was evaluated via qRT PCR in a  total of 50 BD patients in addition to healthy controls  Fig. 8 . Both hub  miRNAs demonstrated aberrant expression  of them Hsa miR 19b 3p  showed downregulation  while hsa miR 23b 3P was upregulated in BD  patients compared to healthy individuals.  4.Discussion  As one of the most significant mental conditions  bipolar disorder  is  a highly heritable psychiatric disorder  27 . Investigations on the blood  and post mortem brains of people with this disorder have found aberrant  gene expression  28 . Gene Ontology Analysis of the genes has revealed  molecular mechanisms that appear to be crucial in the pathogenesis of  the psychological disorders. In the past few years  changes in miRNA  expression have been recognized to have a role in pathophysiology of  mental illnesses and have the potential to behave as peripheral bio  markers of disease and therapy response. So  investigating common  miRNA biomarkers of BD may assist comprehend its connection pa  thology and developing treatments to decrease the symptoms in BD  patients. Numerous miRNAs showed the ability to significantly differ   entiate between patients with BD and healthy  normal ones. In the  present study  we formed a regulatory pattern implicating the  BD specific mRNAs miRNAs by merging all the regulatory details  received from our results. According to the bioinformatic databases  we  identified 148 DEGs and 16 crucial DEMs  including 11 upregulated and  5 downregulated  from bipolar samples and adjacent normal in  dividuals. In a subsequent analysis  we selected hsa miR 23b 3p and  hsa miR 19a 3p based on p value  fold change  and their known role as  regulators of gene expression in patients with BD. Our findings  demonstrated that compared with controls  miR 23b 3p was noted to be  considerably more upregulated and miR 19b 3p was downregulated.  These two miRNAs have great potential to be a useful tool for the  diagnosis of BD and directly regulates the expression of several DEGs   miR 19b 3p shows the direct impact on several DEGs such as ACP1   NPTN  NBEA  NDEL1  TCEAL1  and RNF1. However  the  hsa miR 23b 3P directly regulates the expression of several other DEGs  including CASD1  DSTN  ADAM23  and IPO5 . All of these target genes  were demonstrated to be involved in the NOS process  regulation of  organic acid transport  regulation of cellular response to insulin  Fig. 3.Dysregulated signaling pathways and interacted genes  nodes with red mark  after functional enrichment analysis using ClueGO  a Cytoscape plug in.

In another study  serum  expression levels of miR 23b 3p significantly increased in bipolar dis  order patients  34 . However  many researches confirmed the role of  specific pathways in initiation and development of BD. Modified NOS  signaling has been associated with the pathophysiology of BD  35 37 .  In a recent study conducted by Loeb et al. NOS activity revealed as a  promising biomarker for major depressive disorders  38 . In addition to  the NOS pathway  in multiple studies  the importance of the regulation  of the organic acid transport pathway has also been described in BD  39 . Based on experiments  patients with BD had a more increased level  of Uric Acid  particularly in mania seizures. Uric Acid may be a potential  biomarker to indicate BD  40 .  Besides all these investigations and in silico analytic results  we also  conducted a series of experiments on 50 BD patients compared to normal  individuals  which had the same results from statistical studies. Ac  cording to our qPCR results  Hsa miR 19b 3p was shown to be down   regulated  p value  0.0027   while hsa miR 23b 3P was shown to be  upregulated  p value  0.0433 .  5.Conclusion  In the current analysis  we examined circulating miRNAs in plasma  samples of patients with BD in comparison to those of normal healthy  controls among illness episodes like mania and depression. 87 DEGs and  16 DEMs showed significant alterations in patients with BD in com  parison to healthy individuals  among these genes and miRNAs  hsa   miR 23b 3p and hsa miR 19a 3p  and their related DEGs such as  ACP1  NPTN  NBEA  NDEL1  TCEAL1  RNF1  CASD1  DSTN  ADAM23   and IPO5 expressed significantly. Moreover  the ROC analysis and qPCR  were confirmed that miR 23b 3p  AUC  0.8 and p value   0.0433  was  noted to be considerably more upregulated and miR 19b 3p  AUC  1 and  p value   0.0027  was downregulated in patients with BD. Our findings  imply that these two miRNAs may be biomarker candidates for BD.  Ethics approval and consent to participate  All patients gave their signed written informed consent letters.
