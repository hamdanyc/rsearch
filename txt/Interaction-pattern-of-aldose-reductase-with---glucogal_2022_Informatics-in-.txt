In  diabetes  there are so many potential drug candidates  however  systematic research is necessary to put candidate  molecules into effect.   glucogallin  PubChem CID  124021  found in Emblica officinalis is explored as a potential  candidate molecule to inhibit aldose reductase activity  a key enzyme related to the microvascular complications  in diabetic patients. High resolution crystal structure of human aldose reductase  ALR2   PDB ID   1pwm    from   Protein Data Bank   was retrieved  and active site determination was done using   CASTp   and blind docking  strategies.  Swiss Dock   blind docking revealed a total of 13 active residues  which were found common in the  five best binding modes in regard to their free binding energy. The active residues were utilized again to  selectively dock   glucogallin  PubChem CID  124021  in  Swiss Dock   for which the average free binding energy  was  8.07884 kcal mol calculated from 5 best binding modes. Additionally  a selective docking analysis was  performed in  Auto Dock 4.2 using a genetic algorithm where the same binding mode was observed. The lowest  binding energy calculated in Auto Dock was  17.37 kcal mol with an inhibition constant of 186.59 fM  which is  substantial to prove the efficacy of this molecule as a potential drug target. In both docking platforms  the  interaction pattern stayed in the same orientation. So  this study showed the interactions pattern of   glucogallin   PubChem CID  124021  with tentative active sites of aldose reductase  ALR2   PDB ID  1pwm  in details which  may open up future possibilities for treating patients with diabetic microvascular complications.    1.Introduction  The term  diabetes   refers to a disease condition that has been  around for centuries. Diabetes is currently one  if not the most common  long term disease condition related to pancreatic dysfunction  1 . In  2017  the International Diabetic Federation  IDF  reported a global  occurrence of diabetes in 415 million people worldwide  2 .  Diabetes  although being a severe disease  becomes lethal when the  complications associated with it contribute even more to the mortality  rate. Diabetes induced microvascular complications owe to the mortality  rate associated with this disease  1 . In Bangladesh  diabetic patients  suffer from various microvascular complications  which progresses into blindness  nerve impairment or renal damage at later stages. Astonish   ingly  In a cross sectional study   3  in Bangladesh  It has been reported  that a total of 49 264 patients with diabetes went through eye screening  in just 2 eye hospitals  clearly indicating the severity of the situation.  Hyperglycemia and its relation to the polyol pathway produce excess  sorbitol which accumulates in the cell and helps in the formation of  reactive oxygen species  4 . Additionally  this causes the NADPH to  upregulate nitric oxide production and glutathione reduction  leading to  hemolysis. Sorbitol accumulation generates oxidative stress in cells and  creates osmotic pressure since the polarity of sorbitol prevents its  diffusion through the cell membrane  5 . Sorbitol accumulation also  inactivates the glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase since the   Corresponding author.

This leads to the formation of meth   ylglyoxal  a precursor of the advanced glycation end product and diac  ylglycerol  DAG . These products can ultimately cause diabetic  neuropathy or retinopathy  6 7 .  Diabetic patients suffer damage to the retina or nerve cells due to  excess sorbitol accumulation  8 . The polyol pathway is governed by a  critical oxidoreductase enzyme called aldose reductase  AR . It converts  glucose to sorbitol with the help of cofactor NADPH. Although sorbitol  dehydrogenase converts sorbitol to fructose  increased concentration of  glucose again leads to the accumulation of sorbitol  6 . Since AR is  directly involved in the production of sorbitol  limiting its glucose up  take with a proper inhibitor molecule can significantly decrease sorbitol  accumulation and lessen the severity of complications such as diabetic  retinopathy and neuropathy  6 .  AR is a challenging drug target as it can bind various substrates in  induced fit adaptation  5 .  Zenarestat    PubChem CID  5724    fidare   stat   PubChem CID  160024    minalrestat    PubChem CID  190816     alrestatin    PubChem CID  2120  are some of the already explored in  hibitors of AR  9 11 . However  when tested in clinical trials  most of  the inhibitors failed to completely prevent the onset or reverse the tissue  injury of retinopathy or neuropathy except for  zenarestat    which had  only been successful for neuropathy. So  a more potent inhibitor mole  cule needs to be explored in order to prevent diabetic blindness  nerve  and renal damage.    glucogallin  1 O galloyl    D glucose   PubChem CID  124021   a  plant polyphenol  is one of the emerging inhibitors of AR. It has been  reported to reduce oxidative stress in cultured retinal epithelial cells  against methylglyoxal  12 . It has been very successful in in vitro studies  so far and has the potential to outperform its predecessors  13 14 .    glucogallin  PubChem CID  124021  can be extracted easily from the  fruit of Emblica officinalis or amla which is very abundant in south Asia   4 . The Emblica officinalis or amla is being used effectively in south Asia  for a long time to treat diabetic complications with adequate success.  Many local Ayurveda companies sell extracts of amla as a diabetic  medicine. So  the chemical interactions behind this effectiveness must  be addressed.   Amla    Emblica officinalis   is also found in Bangladesh where it is  popular by the name  amloki  . It is found all around the country   including Bandarban  Sylhet  Khagrachori  Vawal  Modhupur  Ranga   mati and Gazipur. Due to the abundance of this plant    glucogallin   PubChem CID  124021  which can be found in  amloki   is the best   suited lead molecule to work on  which can prevent diabetic retinop   athy and neuropathy.  The active three dimensional conformation of ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm   has two types of pockets  an anionic binding pocket comprising Trp111   His110 and Tyr48 residues and a hydrophobic specificity pocket  comprising Thr113 and Leu300 residues. Most of the researches  designing potentials inhibitors of AR targeted these two sites for virtual  screening. This enzyme generally carries out the reaction of aliphatic  and aromatic aldehydes reduction to alcohol  5 10 .  There are numerous aldose reductase inhibitors which has been re  ported up until now. Some inhibitors are coumarin based  some are  indole based and some are cyclic imide or acetic acid derivatives.  Coumarin based thiosemicarbazone derivatives performed well as  aldose reductase inhibitor in a recent study  15 . Indole substituted  thiosemicarbazones have also shown great efficacy for aldose reduc   tase  16 . Thiazoline derivatives have also shown great promises in the  inhibition of aldose reductase  17 . In addition  a cyclic imide inhibitor   fidarestat  PubChem CID  160024  which also performed great against  aldose reductase  10 . Interestingly    glucogallin  Pubchem CID  124021  is a bit different from the inhibitors mentioned above and is  quite promising as aldose reductase inhibitors. The molecule is also  synthesized naturally making it really accessible and cost friendly.  Fidarestat  PubChem CID  160024  is an ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm  in  hibitor which has performed really well in clinical study  18 . It has a  hydantoin moiety that interacts with the anion binding pocket of ALR2  PDB ID   1pwm    while the carbamoyl moiety of fidarestat  PubChem  CID  160024  can form hydrogen bond with the hydrophobic specificity  pocket. The interacting residues are Tyr48  His110  Trp111 and Leu300   10 . In case of minalrestat  PubChem CID  190816   the succinimide  moiety interacts with anionic pocket while the isoquinoline ring at  taches inside the specificity pocket. The interacting residues in this case  are Tyr48  His110  Trp111  Trp20  Phe122  and Trp219  10 . Interest   ingly  all of these residues are found to be the interacting residues in case  of the   glucogallin  PubChem CID  124021  molecule with additional  polar and hydrogen bonds.    glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021   on the other hand  is a short  molecule having 11 torsional degrees of freedom  10 . It is a plant  polyphenol formed from the esterification of gallic acid and   D glucose  via gallate 1 beta glucosyltransferase enzyme. The galloyl residue is on  the first carbon naming the compound 1 O galloyl    D glucose.   glu  cogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  is also the precursor of hydrolyzable  tannins  ellagitannins and gallotannins   which alleviates cancer and  cardiovascular disease risk. In plants    glucogallin has numerous  functions  including protection against plant pathogen or solar radiation   19 . Since this molecule has a tetrahydropyran ring system  oxane ring   and a benzoic acid ring  it behaves both as a hydrogen bond donor and  acceptor. It has a molecular weight of 332.26 g mol and a XlogP3 of   1.4.  This study aimed to identify the tentative active sites of aldose  reductase  ALR2   PDB ID  1pwm  for the inhibitor molecule   gluco   gallin  Pubchem CID 124021  and to understand the interactions pattern  between them by means of molecular docking techniques. This research  aims to promote   glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  molecule for in   vivo chemical studies for treating patients with diabetic microvascular  complications.  2.Materials and methods  2.1. Determination of ALR2 active site  This study focuses on understanding the possible binding interaction  between human aldose reductase  PDB ID  1pwm  and   glucogallin   Pubchem CID 124021   a potential inhibitor. ALR2 has been reported to  have two possible binding sites based on its crystal structure with in  hibitor fidarestat  PubChem CID  160024   10 . Coupled with NADPH   this enzyme can conduce in the reduction of aldehydes to alcohols. The  two binding sites reported in its crystal structure  PDB ID  1pwm  are the   anionic binding pocket   comprised of Tyr 48  His 110 and Trp 111 and  the  hydrophobic specificity pocket   comprising residues Thr 113 and  Leu 300 and these residues had been taken into consideration due to  their specificity for several inhibitors  4 5 . CastP online tool had been  used for detecting active residues  Online link  http   sts.bioe.uic.edu   castp index.html 2was    20 . Blind docking was done for ALR2 with    glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021   and the interactive residues for  the best binding poses were matched with the active CASTp residues.  2.2. Docking with  Swiss Dock    online link  http   www.swissdock.ch      Swiss Dock   is an online docking platform. It runs on the EADock  DSS engine. The web program uses different setup scripts to solve  common problems associated with the target protein and small ligand. It  has a clean and simple interface with a supportive Python or Perl plugin   21 . The website also comprises a database of existing protein ligand  manual complexes used as raw material for docking analysis. The al  gorithm predicts binding modes on the cavities of the target protein  and  energies are calculated based on CHARMM force field  21 22 . The  binding models are ranked using FACTS and implicit solvation model. It  also uses the comprehensive distance based method to identify protein  and non protein part. The ligand is prepared using Merc Molecular Force  Field  MMFF   22 . The program has a very ease of use interface and  contains state of the art docking setup  especially for drug design. The M.A. Ashik et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100938 3docking procedure doesn  t require any computing power as the whole  process is done using their dedicated server.  The targeted protein and ligand preparation were done by the  Swiss  Dock   server  making it incredibly easy. It supported both blind docking  and specific pocket docking. Our targeted protein AR  PDB ID  1pwm   had an excellent resolution  0.92    to begin with  and active cavities  had already been identified by several articles  5 10 11 . Additionally   CASTp server was used to find out active residues and compare them  with the active sites mentioned in the articles. At first  blind docking was  done for   glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  to find out the active  residues involved with the interactions. Afterwards  specific docking  was done for   glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  again to see if the  same binding pose and energy is found. Additionally  blind docking was  done for fidarestat  PubChem CID  160024  to assess the software ac  curacy by comparing the pose with the crystal structure  PDB ID  1pwm   found in PDB. The accuracy was chosen among the three dockings  presets available in the  Swiss Dock   web server.  After the completion of the docking procedure  the results were both  viewed and analyzed using  UCSF Chimera    developed by the Resource  for Biocomputing  Visualization  and Informatics at the University of  California  San Francisco  with support from NIH P41 GM103311   version 1.14   23  and  PyMOL    version 2.3.2   24 . Initially  the  result file from  Swiss Dock   can only be viewed and analyzed using   UCSF Chimera    Viewdock   plugin. But the Binding poses can be  manually saved as  PDB   format file and analyzed using  PyMOL   as  well. The interaction of the binding pose of ligand was considered within  the 5   area of the protein  s active site. Possible hydrogen bonds and  polar interactions were calculated for 5 binding modes of   glucogallin   Pubchem CID 124021  and fidarestat  PubChem CID  160024  mole  cules. For the  PyMOL   analysis  all the distances were calculated  manually in which a range of 2.8 4.2   distance was used to identify  suitable hydrogen bonds. Both the  UCSF Chimera   and  PyMOL    analysis were done simultaneously for similar binding poses to deter   mine correct binding interactions between the active site and Inhibitor  molecules    glucogallin and fidarestat .  2.3. Docking with  AutoDock 4.2   The crystal structure for the human ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm  was  downloaded from the protein data bank  PDB . The   glucogallin   Pubchem CID 124021  .sdf format was converted to .pdb using   FROG2    25  and consequently formatted to .pdbqt prior to working  with AutoDock 4.2. The ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm  crystal structure was  prepared by adding and distributing  Kollman charges .  Generally  molecules having 10 or so torsional degrees are good  candidates for AutoDock 4.2 because AutoDock 4.2 uses genetic algo  rithm. The   glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  is a molecule having 11  torsional degrees of freedom  making it a suitable candidate for the  AutoDock 4.2 analysis. The receptor ALR2  1pwm.pdb  was prepared in  AutoDock 4.2 using the default commands available for repairing  missing atoms and equal distribution of charges. The grid parameters  were set by calculating the X  Y and Z coordinates calculated from the  active site residues. After setting the grid  the charged   glucogallin was  docked into the active site. The number of runs was 30 with a population  size of 300. It is important to note that to test the efficacy of the  experiment  the docking was run at multiple occasions.  AutoDock 4.2 is an updated version of AutoDock which surpasses its  predecessors in terms of performance and time utilization. This docking  tool has been reported in various articles to be fast  accurate and reliable   26 28 . AutoDock 4.2 fuses  Lamarckian genetic algorithm   and an  experimental free energy force field  29 . In addition to having  grid based predictions  AutoDock 4.2 also uses a crystal clear side chain  conformational modelling to predict accurate binding modes. This tool  is also very convenient for covalent interaction between ligand protein  complexes  30 .  The tool is well validated against a set of 188 protein ligand complexes. Ligands with torsional degrees of 10 or fewer have good  docking results since the binding poses found are well within 3.5   of the  crystal structures  30 .  3.Results  3.1. Active site of human aldose reductase  ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm   The blind docking of   glucogallin revealed active site residues in the  best binding poses that matched the active residues found in CASTp   Table 2 . The binding site of ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm  can be viewed in  Fig. 1. Blind docking of  fidarestat   showed a binding pose that was  within 2   of the crystal structure complex  PDB ID  1pwm  which  proved the efficacy of the blind docking with small ligand such as    glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021 .  3.2.  Swiss Dock   result  The blind docking unraveled the same active sites found in CastP   Table 2 .   glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  was found to have  numerous possible hydrogen bonding and polar interaction with the   anionic binding pocket  Tyr 48  His 110 and Trp 111    and additional  residues  Asp 43  Cys 298  Ser 210  of ALR2  Tables 3 7 . Five confor   mations of   glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  were considered ac  cording to the best binding energy found  Figs. 2 6 . For all the five  binding poses  it was found that a total of 13 residues of ALR2 were  always involved in the interaction with both the benzoic acid ring and  the oxane ring of the   glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  molecule   Table 8 . These 13 residues were used for selective docking of   glu  cogallin  Pubchem CID 124021 . The resulting energy for the selective  docking was found to be very close to the average energy found in the  five best poses in blind docking  Tables 9 and 10 .  The blind docking of  fidarestat    PubChem CID  160024  with ALR2   PDB ID  1pwm  and  UCSF Chimera   analysis showed the exact binding  affinities found in  PDB  . The binding pose is also within 2   of the  crystal structure of ALR2  PDB ID 1pwm   Fig. 7 . These data solidly  support the binding pose found for   glucogallin  Pubchem CID  124021 .  Fig. 7 .  3.3.  AutoDock 4.2   The results obtained from AutoDock 4.2 analysis are promising. A  total of 30 conformations are generated from which 5 distinct Binding  modes have been selected based on energy minimization. The binding  modes showed an average free binding energy of  15.672 kcal mol  while the lowest energy was  17.37 kcal mol. The inhibition constant  found for the rank 1 binding mode was 186.59 fm which tells us the  potential of   glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  as a potent inhibitor.  The binding mode information with their respective binding energy and  inhibition constant are shown in Table 11. The final binding pose reveals  the same active site found in  Swiss Dock   with residues Tyr 48  His 110  and Trp 111  Asp 43  Cys 298 and Ser 210  Figs. 8 10 .  4.Discussion  4.1. Validation of  CASTp    CastP   geometrical calculations are based on three models. They are   Delaunay triangulation     alpha shape   and  discrete flow    31 34 . A  convex hull is created by using a 2D model of the associated atoms and  stretches them in a way where atom disks are encapsulated inside the  convex hull to centralize them. Then the structure is triangulated both  internally and to the edges in such a way so that no overlap or gap oc  curs. This is  Delaunay triangulation   and it s correlated with  Voronoi  diagram   for mapping the atoms with equal distances from each other  along  Voronoi    32 . The  Voronoi   edges and vertices remap the M.A. Ashik et al.

In this way  all the molecule  s cavities are  determined and the active cavity size is determined by subtraction of the  sum of all triangles and the fractions of the atom disks harboring within the triangle. The procedures for measuring the area and volume of the  cavities are also very accurate  32 36 . The discrete flow is used finally  for the identification and measuring of the pockets. As the name sug  gests  the discrete flow calculates the flow of empty triangles that forms  a cavity with the edges of the cavity extending to portions of atom disks  harboring nearby. The size of the molecular pocket in 2D is calculated by  subtracting the mouth of the cavity according to its empty edges from Table 1  shows the anionic pocket and hydrophobic specificity pocket interactions of  fidarestat  .

Both the existing  and the calculated active residues are compared in conjunction to the    glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  interaction with the enzyme ALR2   PDB ID  1pwm . Since the active residues found interacting with    glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  is showing an active site similar to  other inhibitors like  fidarestat    PubChem CID  160024   the idea of  ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm  as an enzyme with its definite active site as per  literatures is not hindered  5 . However    glucogallin  Pubchem CID  124021  is much larger than its predecessors having more hydrogen  bond donors and acceptors with a high molecular weight. For this  reason  numerous residues of ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm  were found inter  active with it. For this study  we have selected the common ones that were found in the best binding poses. Coincidentally  these residues  reside in the active site  similar to what has been reported previously on  the enzyme  5 10  with the addition of some new residues involved in  the interaction.  4.3.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100938 6accurate binding modes  which matches with the binding pose  witnin 2     of the 251 test complexes from  Ligand Protein Database    LPDB .  Success rates range from 54 to 70   depending on the various presets   the highest being the accurate preset. Also  the accuracy increases for  molecules with less than 10 rotatable bonds up to 93   most of which  are  FDA   approved drugs  21 22 . These shreds of evidence suggest  that this web docking tool is pretty reliable when it comes to  small molecule docking. Our compound of interest    glucogallin is a  small molecule having 11 rotatable bonds. So  in terms of accurate  binding modes  overall accuracy was ensured.  The  CHARM22   along with multi objective scoring function  makes  this docking tool very powerful and accurate  22 . The  EADock2   is a  globally renowned engine due to its flexible algorithm and real world  applications  37 38 . The  Swiss Dock    EADock DSS  engine is based  on the key concepts of  EADock2   which is very much accurate when it  comes to working with drug like small molecules. For blind docking  the  DSS engine uses  LIGSITE   algorithm to find out active cavities where  3D grid system is in play. It then uses the sample biasness method to  generate new conformations for each cavity. The sampling technique is  quite reliable and uses sequential dihedral space optimization.  Following this step  the engine filters and removes redundant and poor  conformations to keep the best poses. Sorting of the conformations is  done by simple fitness followed by utilization of  Newton  Raphson    minimization and calculation using  CHARMM  .  FACTS solvation en  ergy   is used for evaluating the clusters formed. Finally  cluster refine   ment and ranking are done according to the full fitness. The clusters  contain all the conformation generated for each binding mode. The  newly devised algorithm that  Swiss Dock   uses is evaluated using test  set comparison of RMSD between crystal structure and algorithm  generated pose within confinement of RMSD 2  . The  EADock DSS   engine is well evaluated with the benchmark  EADock2   and results are  promising with 96  success rate for compounds having fewer than 15  dihedral angles  22 . Our candidate molecule   glucogallin has 11  rotatable bonds  a very suitable molecule to be tested out in this envi  ronment. So  it is safe to say the energy calculation is quite accurate in  this case.   Swiss Dock   gives binding poses and corresponding values for  relative free binding energy. According to the docking analysis per  formed   Tables 3 7   it is clear that the residues Trp 20  Asp 43  Tyr 48   Cys 298  Ile 260  His 210 and Ser 210 are interacting with both the  oxane ring and benzoic acid ring in multiple binding poses. As for the  conformation of the   glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  itself  the  binding pose should be very accurate as blind docking of  fidarestat   PubChem CID  160024   gave us similar binding pose as to the crystal  structure complexed with  fidarestat   PubChem CID  160024   Fig. 1 .  The interaction pattern is also the exact same as the one derived  Fig. 4.Binding mode 3 of   glucogallin.   Fig. 5.Binding mode 4 of   glucogallin.   Fig. 6.Binding mode 5 of   glucogallin.

This definitely proves the  candidacy of   glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  as a potent inhibitor  comparable to its predecessors like  fidarestat    minalrestat or alrestatin   10 11 .  4.3.1. Validation of AutoDock 4.2  AutoDock 4.2 provides energy prediction based on thermodynamic  modelling. This tool calculates the transitional energies for two states   unbound state and bound state. The ligand molecule is flexible and its  binding modes are compared with its unbound states. Although previous  versions of AutoDock considered the protein part being rigid  meaning  Fig. 7.A.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100938 8its flexibility is limited. The AutoDock 4.2 incorporates comprehensive  intermolecular energy calculation with a satisfying desolvation that  covers the correct distribution of charges. In addition  the energy  calculation also considers dispersion repulsion  hydrogen bonding and  electrostatics  39 .  It is quite clear from the results that   glucogallin  Pubchem CID  124021  can successfully bind and inhibit ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm .  AutoDock simulation gave the same result like as  Swiss Dock   where  similar binding mode in the same active site was observed. The docking  was done with the 13 active residues found for   glucogallin  Pubchem  CID 124021   Table 7 . The inhibition constant for the best 5 binding  poses were also very much noticeable.  4.4. Overview of the result  The symmetrical conformation and interaction pattern found on both   Swiss Dock   and AutoDock 4.2 with the same active 13 residues give a  really good overview of how the   glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021   behaves when it comes in contact with ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm . This  research proves different interaction patterns and the involvement of  different active sites in inhibiting ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm  which will provide great insight into the chemical studies of   glucogallin  Pub  chem CID 124021  as an inhibitor molecule.  Several in vitro tissue studies have already been successful for this  particular molecule on ALR2  12 14 . This study also contributes to the  idea of   glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  being very effective on  reducing ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm  activity while also showing the inter  action pattern for this ligand molecule.  4.5. Limitation  A particular limitation of this study is that the docking analysis was  done on rigid flexible principle where only   glucogallin  Pubchem CID  124021  poses were shown. Future dynamic simulation studies will  show the inhibition pattern of this molecule based on a flexible ALR2   PDB ID  1pwm  which could pave the way for extensive in vitro and in   vivo research.  5.Conclusion  According to the data found in  Swiss Dock   and AutoDock 4.2  it is  quite clear that the interaction between ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm  and    glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  is significantly different than other  potent inhibitors with numerous hydrogen bonding and possible weak  interactions. Although beta glucogallin  Pubchem CID 124021  seems to  occupy the same region of ALR2 as the  fidarestat   but in reality  the  interaction pattern is quite different based on active residues and  binding modes. The binding modes were also confirmed to be exactly the  same throughout multiple docking analyses  which strongly suggests the  accuracy of the in silico tools used in this study. The next phase of this  study will be the molecular dynamic simulation  where the relative  flexibility of ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm  will reveal the exact molecular  mechanism of inhibition. This study will pave the way for many re  searchers as a starting point since the active residues were found from  substantial docking data using multiple tools as guiding points. Final  results definitely promote and explain the active site information of  ALR2  PDB ID  1pwm  in regards to   glucogallin  Pubchem CID  124021  as an inhibitor molecule.
