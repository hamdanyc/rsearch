Several metabolic comorbidities like polycystic ovarian syndrome  PCOS    type 2 diabetes  T2D   obesity  and cardiovascular disease  CVD  have been associated with female infertility   FI . However  the causal connection and molecular features are still unknown. Here  we have used differentially  expressed genes  DEGs  to uncover various biological targets for a better understanding of FI and metabolic  comorbidities development. We have also identified 1201 DEGs in FI patients relative to healthy controls sharing  a total of 112  126  99  and 176 DEGs with PCOS  T2D  obesity  and CVD. Besides  most of the shared pathways  including calcium ion transport  regulation of acute inflammatory response  adipocytokine signaling  and MAPK  family signaling cascades were identified from GO and KEGG analysis. Furthermore  we have discovered the two  most significant hub proteins  C3 and AGTR1   significant transcription factors  USF2  CREB1  FOXL1  and  E2F1   and potential drugs  oxacillin  cefotaxime  and valproic acid  which were directly related to FI and other  metabolic diseases. Our computational analysis findings revealed the common molecular pathogenesis of FI and  metabolic comorbidities which may direct new avenues of therapy and warrant future experimental validation of  the key targets.    1.Introduction  Infertility has long been a human concern. Female infertility is  defined as the inability to become pregnant after a year or more of un  protected intercourse  1 . Female infertility is a major element of  reproductive health and a worldwide health issue  2 . Around 15  of  couples worldwide suffer from infertility  3 4 . Later life health risk  development such as polycystic ovarian syndrome  PCOS   cardiovas   cular disease  CVD   type 2 diabetes  T2D   and obesity could be an early  indication of female infertility  5 . A variety of infertility related issues build these infertile women  s disorders  6 8 .  Infertility in women can be caused by a medical condition that  damages the fallopian tubes  impairs ovulation  or triggers hormonal  problems. . Pelvic inflammatory disease  endometriosis  polycystic  ovarian syndrome  premature ovarian failure  uterine fibroids  and  environmental factors are among the medical problems mentioned  9 .  The genetic etiology for infertility defined by anomalies in human  egg development  fertilization  and early embryogenesis is not  completely explained. However  numerous investigations have shown  possible gene alterations including PADI6  10   TUBB8  11   Biallelic  Abbreviations  FI   Female Infertility  CVD   Cardiovascular Disease  T2D   Type 2 Diabetes  PCOS   Ploycystic Ovarian Syndrome  DEG   Differential Expressed  Gene  TF   Transcription Factor  MCC   Maximum Clique Centrality  MNC   Maximum Neighborhood Component  IVF   Invitro Fertilization  FFA   Free Fatty Acid   GO   Gene Ontology  OBS   Obesity  PPI   Protein Protein Interaction  SCMC   Subcortical Maternal Complex.

A higher risk of cardiovascular ailment or metabolic dysfunction did  not connect to a general diagnosis of infertility  but women with poly  cystic ovarian syndrome  PCOS  related infertility are more prone than  the general population to develop cardiovascular and other metabolic  diseases like type 2 diabetes  15 17 .  The genetic relationship between infertility and metabolic comor   bidities has been evaluated. In women of reproductive age  PCOS is the  most prevalent endocrine condition. About 6 8  of all women suffer  from this condition  8 . The complex illness of PCOS is caused by  combinations of genetic  endocrine  and environmental factors  18 .  PCOS impacts a woman  s whole life  beginning in utero  manifesting  clinically in adolescence  lasting through the reproductive years  and  exposing patients  according to mounting evidence to a higher risk of  cardiovascular disease  hypertension  diabetes  and other metabolic  problems  19 . Anovulatory infertility may be induced within the fertile  period and is related to an increased risk for prenatal problems including  abortion  gestational disease  and preeclampsia  20 .  It is established that PCOS and obesity increase the risk of female infertility caused by CVD. . The risk biomarkers of infertility such as low   density lipoprotein  LDL   high density lipoprotein  HDL   total choles   terol  TC   triglycerides  TG   insulin resistance  and C reactive protein  were evaluated and these all markers are very crucial to causing CVD   4 . Whether there is a true link between female infertility and CVD  because both entities might follow common routes.  In addition to dealing with ovulation and infertility difficulties in  women  they have significant chances of acquiring other disorders such  as type 2  hypertension  or hypercholesterolemia due to some rapid  metabolic pathways and over expression of some unhealthful proteins  and substances  21 . Only a few researchers looked forward to this issue  and took into consideration both the potential risk factors associated  with diabetes and infertility like body weight and lifestyle factors taking  into consideration. However  a very profound relationship between T2D  and PCOS has been established by earlier studies which revealed both to  be prevalent in resistance to insulin and to balance hyperinsulinemia   22 24 .  In developed countries  obesity rates have risen dramatically over  recent years and affected women by more than 6 15  over the 1975 to  2016 time period  25 26 . Obesity has been linked to infertility in  women through a variety of pathways. Briefly  adipose tissue affects all  ovarian and endometrium functions by the processing of several factors  such as leptin  free fatty acids  FFA   and cytokines which can modify  during oocyte maturation and endometrial epithelium receptivity  27   28 .  Female infertility may certainly be addressed by medicine  small  surgeries  laparoscopic evaluations  and hormone treatment  29 .  Reproductive surgery has the ability in comparison with IVF to restore  subfertile couples   natural reproduction that leads to many conceptions  after a successful intervention  30 . But hormonal intervention  31    reproductive surgery  32   and some existing chemical drugs  33  can  destroy our normal reproductive function and can cause gynecological  complications. There have been numerous research connecting infer  tility and metabolic syndrome  however  a network based approach  between infertility and metabolic comorbidities is not available.  Network data can facilitate the molecular processes connected with  the phenotype of interest to display clear views of the genes or proteins  throughout the system. Transcription factors  TFs  are proteins that bind  to certain DNA sequences to control gene expression. Transcription  factor binding sites are short DNA sequences  5 20 bp in length  that are  specifically bound by one or more transcription factors. Identifying  transcription factor binding sites and predicting their functions are still  difficult computational biology challenges  34 . Through microarray  and bioinformatics data analysis  researchers are looking at the cellular  mechanism of metabolic disorders that are closely linked to female  infertility which can aid in understanding the etiology of these diseases  and target selection of therapeutic interventions. Anovulation must also  be considered not as a diagnosis  but as a symptom of a metabolic or  endocrine disorder that requires a thorough diagnostic assessment to  identify the specific cause and implement effective therapies. Further   ensure the pregnancy results are best achieved and prevent adverse  health consequences in the long term  35 .  Thus  in infertility and metabolic comorbidities  the current study  discovered differentially expressed genes  DEGs   DEG related signaling  and GO pathways  protein protein interaction  transcription factors   DEG analysis  and protein drug chemical identification.

To investigate the impact of FI and its genetic relationship with  other metabolic comorbidities  we collected and analyzed relevant  microarray datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Infor  mation Gene Expression Omnibus database. In our study  5 different  microarray datasets were analyzed  including Female Infertility  FI    Polycystic ovary syndrome  PCOS   Type 2 diabetes  T2D   Obesity   OBS   and Cardiovascular disease  CVD  with the accession numbers of  GSE92324  GSE5850  GSE16415  GSE48521  and GSE24519. For the  selection criteria  we merely have to be included female samples from  various reproductive age ranges between 20 and 45 years old and  considered four sample sources including omentum  oocyte  amniotic  fluid  and platelets tissues rather than the same sources for all diseases.  Besides  for the exclusion criterion  male samples were removed during  the data collection and analysis processes and details information were  presented in Table 1.  4.Data preprocessing and identification of DEGs  To detect molecular features of human diseases using microarray  data  the global analysis of transcriptomes was employed in the FI gene  expression profiles with four diseases  PCOS  T2D  obesity  and CVD . In our work  different errors are routinely compensated for in the pro  duction and analysis of microarray data. The disease group or control  group in each sample must be standardized. The Z score transforms a  popular method for normalizing gene expression matrices  36 38 .  Zij Xij Xi  i i    where  i and Xi are the standard deviation and mean of the predicted  inclusive samples for the i th gene  respectively. This transformation  allows for a straightforward comparison of gene expression data in  various models and disorders. We have completed a linear regression  procedure on data from a time series and this Z score modification for  generating a joint t testing statistic between two groups. The data were  transformed to log2FC  and the linear regression model was used to  calculate the expression levels of each gene using the formula    Y i   0   1Xi                                                                                      In this scenario  Yi is the gene expression value  while Xi represents  the illness state  disease or control . The least squares were used to  calculate model parameters  0 and  1. We have used an unpaired t test  with a p value D0.05 and a complete log fold change  log2FC F1  to  look if any genes are expressed differentially between the disease and  control state  39 . Using NCBI  s GEO2R online tool  40   all datasets  from the NCBI GEO database were studied and discriminated with the  typical subject to recognize consistent genes expressed differentially.  Next  we have compared FI datasets with four other selected disorders  through the Venny v2.1  https   bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es tools venny     online tool to find the common DEGs  41 . Finally  the gene disease  association network  GDN  was created and visualized in Cytoscape  v3.8.2  42 .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100960 44.1. Pathway enrichment analysis  For all of the genes that were differently expressed in FI and its risk  factors  the metabolic pathways of FI were examined using the web   based gene set enrichment analysis application too EnrichR  https     maayanlab.cloud  Enrichr  . To attain better results  the better  enrichment of the p value was used for statistical significance. We ac  quire the top 20 functional analyses of biological processes  cellular  components  and molecular functions. Signaling pathways  KEGG  WiKi   and Reactome  were used as an annotation source for the study  43 45 .  We select the top 20 based on the p value. The enrichment plots were  visualized as a bubble plot and generated through R studio  45 .  4.2. Protein interaction analysis  The web based visualization software STRING  https   string db.  org    46 47  was utilized for the network protein protein interaction  network building and investigation. Then  Cytoscape  v3.8.2  was used  for further evaluation like visualization and network analysis purposes A  non oriented graph of protein nodes and edges indicating protein in  teractions represents the PPI network. We have utilized Cyto Hubba  plugin to do the topological analysis to categorize interconnected proteins  i.e.  hub proteins . Then  we have employed 4 strategies of the  cytohubba plugin which included three methods of local rank  i.e. de  gree  maximum neighborhood component  MNC   maximum clique  centrality  MCC   and one global rank method i.e. betweenness. The  hubs of the local methods showed the connection between the node and  the local neighbor node  whereas the global method ranked hubs indi  cated the interaction between the node and the whole network  48 49 .  Finally  the networks were analyzed through Cytoscape v3.8.2 of each  cytohubba plugin.  4.3. Identification of transcription factors interact with common DEGs  By using the Network analyst tool  https   www.networkanalyst.  ca    we were able to uncover topologically credible TFs that bind to  our shared DEGs in the JASPAR database. JASPAR is a freely accessible  database of TF profiles from a variety of organisms spanning six taxo  nomic categories  50 51 .  4.4.

It used network analysts to look for protein drug  interactions in the drug bank database to uncover potential drugs that  might interact with our common DEGs  53 54 .  4.5. Gene  disease association analysis  DisGeNET  https   www.disgenet.org    is a standardized gene   disease association database that incorporates correlations from  various sources involving various biological features of disorders. It  emphasizes the increasing understanding of human genetic illnesses   55 . It also examined the gene disease connection using a network  analyzer to find diseases and chronic problems associated with common  DEGs  56 .  4.6. Overview of analytical approach  After the collection of 5 microarray datasets from NCBI  then we  analyzed datasets through online tools of GEO2R. Identification of DEGs  from each dataset  we performed a cross comparative analysis and also  constructed a gene disease network  pathway enrichment  PPI network   hub gene topological network  gene regulatory network  protein drug  interaction network  and other gene disease associations network. The multi stage quantitative method has been designed and implemented for  these studies as an integrated bioinformatics and system biology appli   cation  as shown in Fig. 1.  5.Result  5.1. Gene expression analysis  Dysregulated genes linked to FI during implant failures and meta  bolic disorders including PCOS  T2D  CVD  and Obesity were examined  and differentiated in the standard subject using Limma utilizing the  NCBI GEO2R Web Tool for the interaction between genetic variation of  endometrial tissues with the oocyte  omentum  platelets  and amniotic  fluid tissues. Compared to normal patients  1201 genes are expressed  differently where 651 genes are upregulated and 550 genes are down   regulated by considering P value D0.05 with Log2FC F1 and Log2FC D  1  respectively. We have employed mRNA data and a series of statistical  analytical tools to study the relationship between FI and four comor   bidities. We have thus chosen the most important up and down   regulated genes for each condition. Our investigation discovered  2230  908  1628  and 3220 DEGs in PCOS  T2D  obesity  and CVD   respectively. A cross comparison analysis identified the up and down   regulated genes with FI sharing a total of 112  126  99  and 176 key  Fig. 4.The gene disease association network for down regulated genes.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100960 6DEGs for PCOS  T2D  obesity  and CVD were shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2.  In Cytoscape  two FI based interaction networks were constructed to  discover statistically significant correlations between these metabolic  diseases. The networks in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 depict the relationship be  tween gene disease networks at over and under expressed levels.  SLC16A6 and SLC26A7 were identified to be over expressed in the  FI  obesity  and CVD  RGS7 and COCH are two up regulated genes  detected in the FI  Obesity  and PCOS  and TTC39C  one key gene is  commonly up regulated in the FI  PCOS  and T2D  respectively. The  three down regulated BICD1  ARHGAP22  and FYB genes are common  in FI  Obesity  and CVD. The FI  Obesity  and PCOS are frequent in two  under expressed genes named FAM3C and MAF. 5.2. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis  Enrichr was employed in the analysis of gene ontology and pathway  enhancement to detect the biological importance of pathways exhibited  by the DEGs. Gene ontology takes into account gene roles and their  components to incorporate comprehensive computable knowledge re  sources. An ontology is a theoretically defined corpus of information  that exists within a specific environment. Annotation and ontology are  also designed to carry out a sophisticated biological structure model  which is commonly employed in biological applications  57 . The  database was used as an annotation source for the gene ontology study  which was done in three areas  biological process  cellular component   and molecular function . Calcium ion transport  regulating acute in  flammatory response  an integral part of the plasma membrane  and  intra molecular oxide reductase activity are the most often used GO  Fig. 5.Functional enrichment analysis of the differential expressed genes in FI and metabolic comorbidities.

The most significant molecular pathways  including adipocytokine signaling pathway  pathway cancer  MAPK  family signaling cascades  and Jak stat signaling pathways were iden  tified in our study and were displayed in Fig. 6 A B .  The pathway investigation reveals how the organism reacts to the  underlying changes. The model is designed to show how numerous  disorders interact through gene regulation and biological processes. 5.3. PPI and hub protein identification  We have studied the PPI network from the STRING database and  displayed it in Cytoscape to anticipate typical DEG connections and  adhesion pathways. The PPI network of common DEGs is depicted in  Fig. 7 which contains 168 nodes and 464 edges. Several associated nodes  in a PPI network are designated as hub proteins at the same time. Using  four different approaches  including degree  maximum neighborhood  Fig. 6.The Enriched  A  KEGG and  B  WIKI pathways are generated from common differentially expressed genes.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100960 8component  MNC   maximum clique centrality  MCC   and betweenness  algorithms  we have identified two hub nodes  C3 and AGTR1  as  candidate hub proteins for therapeutic targets. Nine hub proteins are  common in all local networks except global network betweenness  i.e.   C3  LPAR3  LPAR2  AGTR1  P2RY2  EDN3  OPRK1  GPR132  P2RY6   shown in Fig. 8. But 6 hub proteins were found only betweenness  analysis which is not common in the rest of 3 local networks. These 2  hub proteins have the potential to be crucial indicators leading to novel  treatment policies for investigated ailments. Because the hub proteins  have potential  we built a submodule network to better understand their  close interactions and their proximity using the Cytohubba plugin. Fig. 8  displays an extended network of the hub proteins connections that stem  from the PPI network.  5.4. Identification of transcription factors that interact with common  DEGs  A network based method was used to unravel the regulatory TFs of  the hub proteins of DEGs  and the DEGs TFs linkages networks were  studied to uncover transcriptional and post transcriptional regulatory  fingerprints. Fig. 9 depicts the interactions between DEGs and TFs. The  dysregulated genes are shown by the circles in the picture  while the TFs  are represented by the squares. These interaction networks yielded a  total of 48 transcription factors in FI and four diseases  i.e.  USF2   CREB1  FOXL1  E2F1  MAX  TPS3  NF1C  and PPARG  etc .  5.5. Identification of candidate drugs  The goal was to uncover candidate medications that could potentially alter disease mechanisms while also looking into the protein   drug interaction. Understanding the properties required for sensitive  receptors necessitates an examination of protein drug interactions. The  protein drug interaction research indicated the drug  s interaction with a  hub protein. In our study  11 potential drugs  i.e  Oxacillin  cefotaxime   perhexiline  valproic acid  and isocitric acid  were shown to be effective  against four proteins  ADH1  CPT1A  ACADSB  and SLC15A2  which  were represented in Fig. 10.  5.6. Identification of disease association  The hypothesis that many conditions can be associated or connected  is that they all share one or more genes. Disorder specific therapeutic  interface strategies are an attempt to discover the link between genes  and illnesses. We have shown that 4 possible genes CERKL SLC 24 A  IL   7  and LMCD1 are the most prevalent in Female Infertility  FI  and other  four metabolic disorders including Retinitis pigmentosa 26  multiple  sclerosis  and lymphopenia illness  according to Network Analyst  s  assessment of the gene disease association shows in Fig. 11.  6.Discussion  Bioinformatics approaches provide a comprehensive understanding  of the molecular pathway in disease progression  58 . These in  vestigations have the potential to uncover new genetic connections be  tween FI and other metabolic diseases such as PCOS  T2D  obesity  and  CVD  59 .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100960 9and protein  drug interaction network in FI and metabolic comorbidities  patients.  FI is a complicated disease with many clinical events and mainly  hormonal deficiencies  severe health  and economic consequences  60 .  Using microarray data analysis  the current study identified a list of  essential genes  pathways  and hub proteins involved in FI and meta  bolic disorder pathogenesis. In our study  FI shared a total of 112  126   99  and 176 key DEGs with PCOS  T2D  OBS  and CVD  respectively.  We have identified several essential GO pathways in this study  including calcium ion transport  regulation of acute inflammatory  response  an integral component of the plasma membrane  and intra   molecular oxidoreductase activity which are related to FI and other  metabolic commodities. In their investigation  Ji Shen et al. identified  several GO factors including chromatin remodeling  positive transcript  factor regulation  regulation of smooth cell differentiation  and oxida   tive DNA methylation  61   while another study conducted by Weidong  Zhou also discovered significant GO pathways such as regulation of  transcription and gene expression  biosynthetic processes and cell  development  62  were associated to FI development.  Our study focuses on adipocytokine signaling pathways  cancer  pathways  MAPK family signaling cascades  and Jak stat signaling  pathways which are strongly connected to metabolism and FI develop   ment. Zhou et al. mention that several significant enrichment pathways  including the MAPK signaling pathway  AMPK signaling pathway  Wnt   and FoxO signaling pathway were involved in endometriosis related  infertility throughKEGGanalysis  62 . Besides  recent studies also show that in women with endometriosis  the MAPK signaling pathway is  hyperactive  63 . But in another study  Makker et al. discovered that  PI3K pathway abnormalities are linked to follicular oocyte develop   ment and ovulation problems compared to our findings  64 . Another  area of concern is the androgen and leptin signaling pathway  as the  majority of PCOS women have high levels of androgen as identified by  Afiqah Aleng N studies  65 . A recent study indicates that the endo  metrial epithelial cells of PCOS women show high levels of  cyclin dependent kinase 2  CDK2   cyclin E  and p27  resulting in cell  cycle dysregulation  66 .  A PPI network was built by our research employing common dif  ferential genes based on STRING databases. Such identified hubs pro  teins can be used to identify potential drug targets or biomarkers using  topological analysis techniques. In a four way cytohubba plugin anal  ysis  10 hubs proteins were found in the PPI network. We then discov   ered just two C3 andAGTR1 genes common in all techniques of  cytohubba plugin that may contribute to the development of the FI and  metabolic disorders.  Tao et al. conducted their experiment in women and animals models  of endometriosis demonstrated that complement 3  C3  protein is dys  regulated in endometriosis related cell and peritoneal fluid  67 68 .  Sayegh et al. demonstrated a significant expression of C3 during the  secretary stages of the menstrual cycle  69 . Given that C3 is a charac   teristic marker of chronic inflammation  they hypothesized that SNPs in  C3 may play a role in endometriosis and infertility etiology  70 . Several  ApoC3 gene variants have been linked to the development of insulin  Fig. 9.TF   Dysregulated Genes between FI and figure  A  T2D   B  CVD   C  Obesity  D  PCOS.

Obesity  diabetes  and coronary heart disease are all linked to elevated  levels of C3 and its cleavage product ASP  71 74 .  Genetic study of the AGTR1 gene increased the risk of diabetic ne  phropathy which occurred for extreme obesity and extreme obesity   associated T2DM development  75 76 . The risk of predominant hy  pertension is increased by hypomethylation of the Angiotensin II Type I  Receptor  AGTR1  gene as well as environmental factors  77 .  The lack of rare allele C of SNP  1166 A FC  in AGTR1 genes affects pregnancy violation  78 . The impact of this gene expression during  trophoblast maturation was emphasized by Pringle et al.  79 80 . In  addition to the reduced exposure to estrogen  enhanced activation of an  AGTR1 NF kB pathway may be of importance to EM pathogenesis and  AGTR1 may also be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of  EM according to Zhang et al. study  81 . For comparison  Jiang Y et al.  demonstrated that RBP4 protein expression must be regulated  throughout follicle development to change the retinoid levels in the  ovary  82 . Through a system biology approach to type 2 diabetes  Fig. 10.Protein drug interaction between FI and figure  A  T2D   B  PCOS   C  Obesity  D  CVD.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100960 11development  Hasan I et al. discovered a number of strong potential hub  proteins in important pathways  including RAB25  MAL2  SFN  MYO5B   and HLA DQB1  47 . LIhong LIU et al. conducted a genomewide asso  ciation study to identify three core genes  APOA1  APOB  and APOE   which were mainly correlated with metabolic and cardiovascular dis  eases in offspring by in vitro fertilization  83 . The hub proteins we  discovered for FI and metabolic diseases play a major role in our study.  A total of 48 common types of TFs were found to be the most  important transcription factor in our investigation  including USF2   CREB1  FOXL1  and E2F1.  The continued nuclear protein level of upstream stimulating factor 2   USF2  expression in the secretory phase in eutopic endometriosis  pathogenesis may be substantially related to infertility  84 . Altarejos  et al. indicated that  the central impacts of hormones and nutrition on  energy balance and fertility in the Creb1 Crtc1 pathway  85 . Rajan  et al. have shown that FOXO1 is important to maintain normal human  adipocyte insulin signals and often causes T2D  86 . Besides  Foxl1 is an  indicator of hepatic bipotential progenitor cells  87  and regulates the  function of lung fibroblast  88 .  Overexpression of E2F1 decreased the expression of interleukin in  activated heart cells  89  and E2F1 promotes glucose stimulated insulin  release by directly controlling the expression of the main subunit of the  ATP sensitive K channel  90 . However  these findings demonstrated  that E2F1 contributes to global glucose homeostasis by participating in  the pancreatic formation and maintaining endocrine function.  In our study  we identified 11 possible drugs  i.e. Oxacillin  cefo  taxime  perhexiline  valproic acid  and isocitric acid  etc.  against 4  proteins including ADH1  CPT1A  ACADSB  and SLC15A2. These  protein drug interactions can reveal possible disease mechanisms   whereas hub proteins can contribute as therapeutic targets and drugs  can be utilized to treat diseases  91 .  In our study  we identified 4 potential genes CERKL  SLC24A4  IL7   and LMCD1 that are linked to retinitis pigmentosa 26  92   amelogenesis  imperfect type 3  93   multiple sclerosis  94 95   and mitral valve  insufficiency  96  complications  respectively. The network of gene  diseases can provide a new approach to other diseases at the develop   ment of a molecular level  91 .  Several networks have been used to uncover new genes or the most  important genetic pathophysiology for multifactorial illnesses such as  Alzheimer  s  Cancer  etc  97 98 . H Liu et al. conducted network phar  macology and system biology approach to explore the potential GO  pathway and proteins on anovulatory infertility  99 . Hasan MI et al.  also employed similar methodologies like systems biology and bioin   formatics approach to identify blood based signatures molecules and  therapeutic targets of COVID 19 patients  100 . This approach with  associated comorbidities has not yet been employed for FI and the  absence of a full and vetted repository for FI related genomic  proteo   mic  and clinical information is a significant contributing component. To  support and enhance high performance FI research  including gene  networks and priority studies  we have set up a manually curated  knowledge base with full information on FI genes and metabolic  comorbidities from literature review and sources that we evaluated. It  presently has information on major genes and associated proteins   ontological factors  pathways  TFs  possible drugs  and associated  diseases.  7.Conclusions  In our investigation  the genetic relationship of FI with metabolic  comorbidities was determined using microarray transcriptome data. In  these network based approaches  our data show that FI has a positive  association with PCOS  T2D  obesity  and CVD. Moreover  numerous  molecular and gene ontological pathways have been discovered that  give a clear understanding of the genetic relationship between meta  bolism and FI. The studies of gene expression also discovered hub pro  teins  among which C3 and AGTR1 have a substantial contribution to the development of FI and metabolic comorbidities. USF2  CREB1  FOXL1   and E2F1 were significant TFs that indicate the disease pathophysiology.  Oxacillin  cefotaxime  perhexiline  valproic acid  and isocitric acid can  be used as therapeutic agents against 4 targets ADH1  CPT1A  ACADSB   and SLC15A2 proteins. Finally  four genes CERKL  SLC24A4  IL7  and  LLMCD1 were associated with other diseases including retinitis pig  mentosa  multiple sclerosis  and mitral valve insufficiency that reveal a  new approach to disease mechanism. This method will enable us to  decide however how their connections lead to a better mechanistic  understanding of the genesis of FI and metabolic diseases and offer  innovative methods for precise diagnosis of gene markers and effective  medical therapy. Establish genetic expression and the connection be  tween FI and metabolic comorbidities  further in vitro and clinical  investigation will be necessary for validation of our findings.
