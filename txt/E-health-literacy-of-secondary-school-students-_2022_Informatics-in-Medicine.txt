How  ever  it is essential that the users need a few essential skills and knowledge tips for identifying reliable sources of  information  analyzing and evaluating the information  and applying the knowledge gained in real life contexts   which is referred to as E Health literacy. With increasing reliance on internet technologies  it is essential that  school curriculums incorporate computer literacy and E Health concepts in order to enable students to make  better use of internet technologies and to prevent information misuse.  Objective  The aim of this study is to investigate the E Health literacy levels among the secondary school students  in Saudi Arabia.  Methods  A questionnaire based  E Heals  survey was adopted for collecting the data from students. Twenty Four  schools in six major cities in Saudi Arabia were selected for the study. Purposive sampling was adopted for  identifying the schools  and random sampling was adopted for selecting the classes  Grade 10  in secondary  schools. A total of 3134 students participated in the survey  out of which 476 incomplete surveys were identified   resulting in a final sample of 2658.  Results  Medium to High E Health literacy levels were identified among the participants. Significant differences in  E Health literacy levels was identified among male and female students  T Value  26.5518  p D0.0001   and  also among students in public and private schools  T Value  4.666  p D0.0001 . In addition  younger students  exhibited a higher E Health literacy compared to older students.  Conclusions  Secondary school students reflected good E Health literacy levels in Saudi Arabia. However  there  are discrepancies in literacy levels in relation to gender and type of schools  which need to be addressed by  improving more engaging pedagogic strategies for achieving good E Health literacy rates among all students. In  addition  future studies should focus on the influencing factors of E Health literacy across various population  samples.    1.Introduction  The use of internet and communication technologies  ICTs  has been  rapidly expanding the past few years. Currently  there are 4.57 billion  active internet users  4.17 billion unique mobile internet users  3.96  billion active social media users  and 3.91 billion active mobile social  media users globally reflecting online penetration rate of 59   1 .  Increased access to internet and social media applications can benefit  people in many ways  especially in accessing information and improving  knowledge. Focusing on Saudi Arabia  the number of internet users in  2019 were 28.8 million  reflecting internet penetration rate of 84    which is projected to increase to 36.2 million  97  penetration rate  by  2025  2 3 . Young population  15 24 years  were identified to be  effective users of internet services  spending more than 5 h daily on an  average  4 5   who mainly belong to secondary and tertiary levels in the education  who were also being taught using E Learning approaches  6 .  The internet has transformed the ways of accessing information  and  has become one of the essentials of daily lives  7 . Accordingly  infor  mation consumerism has become one of the major components of all  major industries  especially the healthcare industry  where information  is one of the important elements for delivering care and services to the  people. The internet and social media platforms are few important  sources being used for searching health related information  8 9    especially by the young adults  10 . It was identified that though in  dividuals may be empowered by providing access to health information   they must still possess a requisite high level of health literacy to avoid  information misuse  7 . With the development of ICTs  health literacy  has blended and evolved simultaneously  leading to the concept of  E Health literacy  11 .  E Health literacy is defined as the ability to read  use computers   E mail address  halhodaib ksu.edu.sa .

Though it appears to be a simple process  it is a multi skill  competency  as it depends on various factors such as ability to use  computer systems to identify eligible sources of information  evaluation  of accessed information  and applying the acquired knowledge in  real life contexts  which may require effective decision making skills.  E Health literacy can be understood as the combination of various lit  eracies or knowledge  which can be used in accessing  analyzing  and  evaluating online health information  and for accessing E Health ser  vices. The various facets of literacies in relation to E Health literacy may  include  traditional literacy and numeracy  and computer  media  sci  ence  information  and health literacies  which may be part of various  subjects in the curriculum  13 .  Although there have been various studies which have focused on E   Health literacy on various populations such as university students  14    aged population  15   adults  16   online health communities  17   most  of these studies are conducted by foreign researchers. As a result  there is  a wide gap between the global research development on the emerging  concept of eHealth literacy and the findings from within Saudi Arabia. In  addition  it is imperative to initiate research on this emerging field  because  the developments in the technology  and recent Covid 19  pandemic have prompted schools and colleges to rely more on  E Learning and improve digital skills of the students by modifying the  curriculum  17 19 . Accordingly  the components of E Health literacy  were taught across various subjects in the curriculum. Focusing on these  aspects  this study aims to address the lack of contextualized studies on  E Health literacy in Saudi Arabia among the adolescents  particularly  those who are transitioning from secondary to tertiary education  where  the level of independence and reflexivity is increased  11 .  2.Methods  The purpose of this study is to investigate the E Health literacy  among the secondary school students in Saudi Arabia. There is a need to  consider different contexts in collecting and analyzing health related  information in the process of addressing E Health literacy  13 .  2.1. Questionnaire design  eHealth Literacy Scale  eHEALS   a self report tool that can be  administered by a health professional and is based on an individual  s  perception of her or his own skills and knowledge within each measured  domain was used in the survey  12 . The questionnaire had eight items  which are related to E Health literacy. Multiple choice answers and  five point Likert scale ratings  20  were used for answering the ques  tions by the participants. The questionnaire was initially designed in  English  a copy of questionnaire is presented in Appendix A   which was  then translated to Arabic using two professional Arabic translators. The  Arabic version questionnaire was designed using QuestionPro applica   tion  and a survey link was generated for accessing the survey. A pilot  study was conducted with 13 randomly selected students from a public  school in Riyadh city  Saudi Arabia  for evaluating the questionnaire.  Based on the feedback from pilot study participants  few changes were  made in relation to the questions   formulation and grammatical errors in  Arabic. In addition  Cronbach  s alpha for all items in the updated and  corrected questionnaire in Arabic was identified to be greater than 0.83   revealing good consistency and reliability. The questionnaire was also  back translated and checked by the authors in relation to its quality and  the meaning of the sentences. No discrepancies were identified in the  questionnaire.  2.2. Procedures   sampling  Secondary school students in various Saudi Arabian schools were  recruited for the survey using the survey link generated through Ques  tionPro application. Prior permission was taken from the school authorities for conducting the survey. Computer labs in the respective  schools were used for the survey  where students were asked to open the  survey link and complete the survey during one of the regular computer  lab sessions. The purpose of the survey was explained to the students  before taking the survey. The students were supposed to provide their  consent by clicking the acceptance checkbox  before starting the survey.  The study has adopted ethical guidelines and anonymity of the partici   pants is ensured in accordance with the ethical compliance and  regulations.  The research was conducted in six major cities including Riyadh   Mecca  Medina  Jeddah  Dammam  Tabuk in order to ensure variation in  student characteristics. These are the major cities which covers more  than 60  of the population  21 . Secondary school students  Grade 10   from twelve private and twelve public schools were purposely chosen to  represent equal distribution of population and school selections. The  criterion considered in selecting the schools was based on the appro   priate representation of schools from Saudi Arabia. Accordingly  cities  from North  Tabuk   East  Dammam   West  Medina   South  Mecca    and Central  Riyadh  regions. About 22.8  of all schools in Saudi Arabia  are located in Riyadh. Considering these factors  two public and two  private schools from each city were selected purposely based on the  judgement considering ease of accessibility  such as procedures for  acquiring permission. Accordingly  twenty Four schools were chosen  through criterion sampling. Medium and large schools  as categorized by  the Department of Education  were considered to ensure maximum  variation. Excluding homogeneous classes  sections of same class   the  section in each school were randomly selected. All the students in each  class were eligible for participating in the survey  however  the decision  to participate was left to them. As a result  there were few participants in  each class who did not participate in the survey. The demographic in  formation of the participants is presented in the Table 1.  Among the 2658 participants  53.9   1435 2658  participants were  male  and 46.1   1223 2658  participants were female. In addition   36.5  participants  981 2658  were aged 15 years  followed by 30.6   participants  824 2658  aged 16 years  21.4  participants  576 2658   aged 17 years  9.1  participants  247 2658  aged 18 years  0.9  par  ticipants  24 2658  aged 19 years  0.2  participants  6 2658  aged 20  years.  2.3. Data analysis  The data was analyzed using significance tests including t tests at  95  confidence interval. In addition  mean and standard deviations for  each item were used to identify the opinions of the participants.  2.4. Ethical approach  Ethical approval  reference number IRB 2021 03 268  for the study  was received from Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University. In addi  tion  the participants were ensured of their privacy and anonymity for  participating in the survey. The survey data is stored in EHeals Ques  tionPro database  which is password protected and can be accessed only  by the researchers. In addition  the participants were fully informed  about the purpose of the study  and about the data usage  which is  strictly for academic purpose. Accordingly  all the guidelines proposed  by ethical committee at university were followed.  2.5. Results  The participants E Health literacy levels reflected above average  skills with respect to various activities as shown in Table 2. Majority of  the participants were identified to be confident in using the information  from the internet. It can be observed that majority of the participants   F75   agreed that they had skills related to all aspects of E Health  literacy except three aspects  item 5  item 6  item 7 . These three aspects  can be related to assessing or evaluating the information identified on H. Alhodaib

Further analyzing the results by gender  interesting findings have  been identified. Significant differences between male and female par  ticipants were identified with respect to E Health literacy as shown in  Table 3. The mean scores of males  Mean  4.7  SD  1.08  and female   Mean  3.5  SD  1.25   identified in the analysis reflected both male  and female have good E Health literacy levels  however  male partici   pants reflected higher E Health literacy levels compared to female par  ticipants. T Value  as shown in Table 3  was found to be  t  26.5518  at  0.05 confidence interval  was identified to be statistically significant  p D0.0001 . Therefore  significant differences in the E Health literacy  between males and females can be observed. Accordingly  differences  were observed between males and females in relation to various items  presented in Table 2. A greater number of males opted  strongly agree   rating 5  and  Agree    rating 4  in relation to various items including I  know what health resources are available on the Internet  Females   69.4   Males  82.8    I know where to find helpful health resources  on the Internet  Females  63.1   Males  85.1    and I know how to  find helpful health resources on the Internet  Females  65.7   Males   84.8    while  a greater number of females opted  strongly agree  rating  5  and  Agree    rating 4  in relation to various items including I know  how to use the health information I find on the Internet to help me   Males  69.2   Females  78.4    I have the skills to evaluate the  health resources and information I find on the Internet  Males  68.5    Females  76.7    and I can identify high quality health resources from  low quality health resources on the Internet  Males  66.6   Females   77.2  .  Further analyzing the results by age  interesting findings have been  identified. Significant differences between the participants were iden  tified with respect to E Health literacy levels as shown in Table 4. The  mean scores of participants aged less than 17 years  Mean  4.3  SD   1.15  and participants aged more than or equal to 17 years  Mean  3.9   SD  1.03   identified in the analysis reflected all the participants had  good E Health literacy levels. T Value  as shown in Table 4  was found to  be  t  8.6503  at 0.05 confidence interval  was identified to be statis   tically significant  p D0.0001 . Therefore  significant differences in the  E Health literacy levels were identified between participants aged less  than 17 years and participants aged more than or equal to 17 years can  be observed.

Further analyzing the results by school type  interesting findings  have been identified. Significant differences between the participants  were identified with respect to E Health literacy levels as shown in  Table 5. The mean scores of participants in private schools  Mean  4.2   SD  1.07  and participants public schools  Mean  4.0  SD  1.11    identified in the analysis reflected the participants in both type of  schools had good E Health literacy levels. T Value  as shown in Table 5   was found to be  t  4.666  at 0.05 confidence interval  was identified to  be statistically significant  p D0.0001 . Therefore  significant differ   ences in the E Health literacy levels were identified between partici   pants in public and private schools can be observed.  A greater number of participants aged in private schools  group 1   opted  strongly agree  rating 5  and  Agree    rating 4   compared to  those in public schools  group 2  in relation to various items including I  know how to use the health information I find on the Internet to help me   group 2  67.3   group 1  89.9    I have the skills to evaluate the  health resources and information I find on the Internet  group 2   75.4   group 1  88.5    and I can identify high quality health re  sources from low quality health resources on the Internet  group 2   68.9   group 1  86.7  .  3.Discussion and conclusion  The majority of the research studies focused on evaluating E Health  literacy among university students  14 22 23   or from other perspec   tives such as older population  15 . Findings from this study has  revealed that there are differences in the E Health literacy among the  genders  where male students exhibited higher literacy levels compared  to female students. These findings were in similar to the studies  11 22 .  The It was identified that internet usage was found to be more prevalent  among males compared to females in Saudi Arabia  24   which can  support the findings achieved in this study. However  these results  contradicted with other studies  26 28   which have identified that fe  males exhibited high internet usage and greater addiction levels to the  internet and social media networking. However  due to socio cultural  norms  females spend more time indoors  and may be involved in do  mestic work as a result of which they may tend to use it less frequently  compared to males  28 29 . Focusing on the age  the findings in this  study have identified that a greater number of younger students  exhibited better E Health literacy levels compared to those of older  students. Though there was not much differences between the ages of  the participants  15 20 years   there was a slight difference observed in  relation to E Health literacy. The findings can be supported by Ref.  23    which reflected that young students exhibited good E Health literacy  compared to older students. The eHealth literacy among the Saudi sec  ondary school students is slightly higher compared to the countries such  as Korea  30   Japan  31  reflecting the mean rating to be between 3.5  and 3.9  and slightly lesser compared to the European countries   32 34 . In relation to the type of school  participants from private  school exhibited better E Health literacy compared to those from public  schools  in similar to the other studies conducted on high school students  in Iran  25  and Philippines  11 . In comparison to the studies  11 21    the student participants  Saudi Arabia  in this study exhibited good  E Health literacy levels. Thus  this study has identified that E Health  literacy among secondary school students in Saudi Arabia was identified  to varying between medium and high levels  with few discrepancies  among genders and type of schools. Therefore  it is essential to identify  the factors leading to these differences  and address them in order to  attain achieve good E Health literacy levels without any discrepancies among the students. Approaches such as creating awareness  including  eHealth topics as a part of school curriculum  and providing additional  training for effective use of the internet for health purpose  and most  importantly increasing the female participation in the internet usage  and education can be implemented for achieving high eHealth literacy  scales in similar to the other countries in the European region.  4.Limitations  There are few limitations  which can be observed in this study.  Firstly  the methodological approach  this study has adopted only  quantitative methods  an online survey questionnaire for collecting and  analyzing the secondary school students E Health literacy levels. How  ever  a mixed method approach  where by adding qualitative ap  proaches such as interviews could have gathered more qualitative and  behavioral data which can be used to analyze the literacy levels in more  detail along with various variables or factors of influence.  5.Implications  Various implications can be drawn from the study. This study con  tributes to the literature by addressing the research gap of lack of  research on E Health literacy among school students in Saudi Arabia. In  light of COVID 19 outbreak  it has become mandatory that the people  need to adopt various preventive measure to protect themselves from  the novel coronavirus infection. In this context  the internet can be one  of the most effective sources for creating awareness among the people   using which users can access important health related information  and  maintain healthy lifestyles. However  it is essential to determine E   Health literacy among the population in order assess the benefits of E   Health  so that necessary E Health strategies can be developed in order  to address any discrepancies or limitations identified. Accordingly  the  findings from this study can be used to improve computer literacy cur  riculum in relation to E Health among the secondary schools in Saudi  Arabia.
