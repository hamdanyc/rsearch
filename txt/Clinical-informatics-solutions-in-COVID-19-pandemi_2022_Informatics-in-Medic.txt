Health information technology and clinical informatics seem to be useful in assisting clinicians  and managers to combat COVID 19. The most common domains in clinical informatics for research on the  COVID 19 crisis were prediction models and telehealth. It is suggested that future researchers conduct scoping  reviews to describe and analyze other levels of medical informatics  including bioinformatics  imaging infor  matics  and public health informatics.    1.Introduction  In December 2019  the outbreak of COVID 19  coronavirus disease  2019   caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2   SARS CoV 2   was started in China. The World Health Organization   WHO  declared the outbreak of COVID 19 as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30  2020  1 . The pandemic  affected nearly all countries with more than 20 million infected patients  and more than 756000 deaths worldwide during the first nine months   2 3 . The WHO declared that the best prevention strategies  especially  in low  and middle income countries  are education and social  distancing  4 5 .   Corresponding author.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100929 2Information Technology  IT  tools have already been shown to be  potentially useful in educating patients and providing remote clinical  services to patients where applicable  6 7 .  Medical informatics  MI  is an area concerned with managing and  using the required information in the fields of health and biomedicine   8 . MI is a general term encompassing key theories  concepts  and  techniques applied to manage and use information in health and  biomedicine  9 . Clinical informatics  CI  is described as the application  of MI techniques to manage patients by employing an interdisciplinary  approach involving clinical and information sciences  10 . There are  various methods used to classify CI applications  for example  one of  these approaches is the classification based on the type of information  used. Basically  two types of information are used in CI  including  patient based and knowledge based. Patient based information is pro  vided by patients themselves and used in patient care in healthcare  settings  while information based on scientific knowledge forms the  basis of healthcare services  8 . Medical and biomedical informatics  plays a vital role in response to the COVID 19 pandemic  11 . CI tools  seem to be useful in distributing information about decisions and con  trolling patients during the pandemic. A review study provided evidence  for different CI applications in clinical settings  which covered three  themes  including CI systems and interventions for providers  CI systems  for consumer health  and methods and guidance in CI  12 . During a  pandemic  CI could be useful in assisting hospital leaders to virtualize  medical care  make clinical decisions  coordinate communications  and  define workflow and compliance  13 . One of the fundamental changes  in healthcare systems is the widespread development of telemedicine to  help patients continue their treatment while maintaining social distance   14 . The application of patient specific and population based fore  casting models could lead to scientific classification of patients and  execution of prevention and control strategies at the national and in  ternational levels  15 .  The results of this study could help clinicians in using and imple   menting clinical informatics systems  CIS . Researchers and CI special   ists could design CIS and apply the information collected to improve  COVID 19 detection and control. Big data could be helpful in model   ling viral mode of action and guiding healthcare policymakers.  This study aimed to investigate the literature to identify the CI ap  plications used in previous studies during the COVID 19 pandemic.  Therefore  the following objectives were pursued  1  identifying pub  lished studies on the COVID 19 pandemic using CI  2  identifying the  most common methods used in published studies  and 3  recognizing  research gaps in pandemic conditions.  2.Methods  The methods used in the present scoping review have already been  described in detail in a review protocol study  16 .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100929 3as follows  1  studies aimed at improving at least one treatment or  management outcome during the COVID 19 pandemic  2  articles  related to health information technology or medical informatics in  terventions  3  randomized clinical trials  quasi experimental studies   before after interventions and interrupted time series   and observa   tional studies  cross sectional  cohort  case control   4  studies pub  lished in English  5  studies published in scientific journals  and 6   studies published during 2019  2020.  Exclusion criteria were as follows  1  articles whose title  abstract  or  full text was not related to COVID 19  2  thesis  book chapters  letters to  editors  editorials  short briefs  reviews or meta analyses  case studies   conference papers  and study protocols  3  articles whose full text was  not available  and 4  studies on contact tracing tools.  2.3. Article screening and data extraction  After searching databases  articles were first selected independently  by two reviewers based on the analysis of their titles and abstracts  and  then studies were subjected into full text evaluation to select them based  on the eligibility criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted the  required data from the eligible articles by employing a pre specified data  collection form. The extracted data were reviewed by a third reviewer to  ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data extraction process.  The extracted data from the studies reviewed were about study sample   study type  objectives  clinical informatics domain  18 19   applied  method  sample size  outcomes  findings  and conclusion.  2.4. Risk of bias  The risk of bias was evaluated by two authors using appropriate in  struments based on the type of each article. In case of disagreement  the  consensus was sought by the third reviewer. The quality of observational  articles  cohort  cross sectional  and case control  was evaluated using  the STROBE tool  20 . In this tool  a higher score means a lower risk of  bias  0 8  high risk  8 16  intermediate risk  and 16 22  low risk . The  quality of prediction studies was assessed using the Prediction model  Risk of Bias Assessment Tool  PROBAST   21   which is used to rate the applicability and risk of bias in diagnostic and prognostic studies.  The quality of quasi experimental studies was evaluated by  employing the Quality Assessment Tool developed by Brown based on  the study of Estabrooks et al.  2001  2009  for pre post intervention  study designs  22 23 . Finally  the Cochrane Collaboration tool was used  to assess the risk of bias in clinical trials  24 .  2.5. Synthesis and analysis  The selected studies were then subjected to thematic synthesis   which is a qualitative analysis used to generate new findings  25 . At  first  the themes of the selected articles were identified through a series  of meetings after summarizing and categorizing the results that seemed  to be relevant into higher order categories. Finally  the selected themes  were arranged according to scientific domains in medical informatics to  provide a comprehensive view  18 19 . The analysis was carried out by  RG  MS  and SE with periodic input provided by a wider team.  3.Results  3.1. Included studies  In this review study  a total of 1882 and 1045 articles were retrieved  from the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases  respectively  Fig. 1 . After  removing duplicates  2716 articles remained. Among which 110 articles  were selected for full text evaluation based on their titles and abstracts.  After full text evaluation  38 articles were removed as irrelevant  and  the remaining 72 studies were included in qualitative synthesis.  3.2. Characteristics of studies  The general characteristics of the 72 studies included in this research  are presented in Supplemental Materials 3  26 40    41 80    81 109 .

As shown in Fig. 2  19 studies were conducted in  China  17 studies in the United States  six studies in Italy  five studies in  the United Kingdom  and four studies in India.  3.3. Risk of bias assessment  In this study  the reporting quality of 27 analytical observational  studies was assessed using the STROBE checklist  Table 2   32 35 37   43 44 48 50 54 56 59 61 69 70 75 76 82 83 87 90 95 100 101 103 .  The highest and lowest scores were related to the introduction and  method sections  respectively. Also  27   10 cases  of the studies did not  disclose their funding sources  resulting in a mean reporting quality  score of 0.73  0.4.  Most of the publications  n  33  didn  t report a bias determination   Item 9 . The discussion section obtained a total quality score of 3.3   0.7. Also  31  83.8   studies obtained an intermediate quality score  32   35 37 40 44 48 50 54 56 59 61 63 69 70 75 77 79 81 83 87 89 90   95 100 101 103   and six  16.2   studies obtained a good quality score   39 43 55 68 85 99 .  Besides  in 12 and 7 studies  the risk of bias in data analysis was high   30 31 34 42 45 46 52 64 71 73 88 107  and unclear  26 28 62 80 86   98   respectively. Overall  the risk of bias was high and unclear in 16   37.2    28 30 31 34 38 42 45 46 52 64 71 73 84 86 88 107  and five   11.6    26 27 57 92 96  studies  respectively. The risk of bias deter   mined by Probast in other studies was low. One study was designed as a  RCT  97 . This study had an overall good quality score. Only one  quasi experimental study was included in this review  53   which ob  tained an overall weak quality score.  3.4. Medical informatics domains  Out of the 72 studies reviewed  26 studies aimed to design and  implement telehealth  32 35  37 43 44 48  50 53 55 56 59  61 69 70   75 76 82 83 87 90 95 100 103    three studies used mobile health   m health   54 101 110    and 43 studies developed prediction models   26 31 33 34 38 41 42 45  47 51 52 57 58 62 64  67 71  74 78 80 84   86 88 91  94 96 98 102 104  107   see Fig. 3 . 3.4.1. Telehealth domain  Among the reviewed studies  26 studies were conducted in the tel  ehealth domain. Of which 24 studies used synchronous methods  such as  online and phone  or video call consultations  35 37 43 44 49 50 53   55 56 59 61 69 70 75 76 82 83 87 90 95 100 103   while two studies  used asynchronous approaches for communication and providing tele  health services  32 48 . Moreover  nine  35   studies designed online  consultations  43 49 50 55 56 59 69 90 100 . In the reviewed studies   video communication was considered as the most suitable type of  patient provider interaction. Also  six  24   studies used video confer   encing technology for creating communication  35 44 60 70 76 82 .  Among the studies reviewed  8  31   studies used the telephone as a  telehealth technology  36 37 53 61 75 83 87 95 . Finally  one  3    study employed a real time telemetry system via Bluetooth to assess  vital signs in isolation wards  103 . Telemetry system was shown in this  study to be significantly safe and reliable in reducing the risk of noso  comial infections and the workload of medical personnel.  Of the 26 studies conducted in the telehealth domain  two  6    studies provided telehealth services through asynchronous communi   cations  32 48  by employing an automated text based active moni   toring system  32  and sending photos  48   respectively. These studies  showed that teleconsultation could enhance patient compliance and  improve doctor patient interaction. The most common outcomes in the  studies evaluated were as follows  satisfaction in six studies  69 76 87   90 95   increased visit volume in three studies  43 60 61   and increased  usage rate in two studies  44 70 . Other outcomes are shown in Table 3.  3.4.2. Mobile health domain  Among the reviewed studies  three  3.5   studies designed and  developed mobile health systems  54 97 101 . Judson et al.  2020   designed a self triage and self scheduling tool based on patients   portal  to provide personalized recommendations and information about  COVID 19  54 . The other two studies applied a mobile platform to  deliver information about COVID 19  101  as well as a psychological  health digital learning package to educate all healthcare staff  97    respectively.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100929 53.4.3. Prediction model domain  Prediction models applied in the reviewed studies were classified  into five main types  which were derived and extended from the two  studies  111 112 . Fig. 4 shows the most common types of prediction  models examined in the reviewed studies and used to organize and  describe the present study findings.  As shown in Table 4  among the reviewed studies  43 articles  developed prediction models  26 31 33 34 38 41   42 45 47 51 52 57   58   62 64 67 71 74 78   80 84 86 88 91 94   96 98 102 104 107 .  It was found that two  4.6   studies were performed on linear models   28 30   18  42   articles were performed on classification models  33   34 38 41 45 46 52 58 64 78 80 88 94 96 98 105 107   and only one   2.22   study was performed on cluster models  42 . Also  21 studies  developed neural networks  of which four  9   studies implemented  artificial neural networks  26 27 31 67   and 17  39.5   studies were  based on deep neural networks  29 51 57 62 65 66 71 74 84 86 91 93   102 104 . Finally  one  2.3   study used natural language processing   NLP   47 .  3.4.3.1. Linear models. Case fatality rate and case recovery rate were  estimated in a study using time  and location based data  28 . Moreover   Ayyoubzadeh et al.  2020  demonstrated that the linear regression  based model could predict the incidence of COVID 19  30 .  3.4.3.2. Classification models. The most common classification algo  rithm used in the reviewed studies was logistic regression  applied in  77.8   n  14  of the studies  34 38 41 45 46 52 64 80 88 94 96 98   105 106 . Decision tree algorithm was used in three studies  38 78 94 .  The other classification algorithms applied in these studies were  Bayesian  33 38   SVM  78 94   random forests  38 94   and KNN  38   78 . Prediction models were developed in five studies to forecast death   41 46 98 105  and hospital mortality rates  80 . Moreover  four studies  used these approaches to classify COVID 19 patients needing to ICU  intensive care unit  care  41 46 98 105 . Also  classification models  were developed in three studies to predict the disease severity  34 64   106 . In addition  three studies used these methods to predict  SARS CoV 2 infection  45 58 88 .  3.4.3.3. Cluster models. Only in one of the reviewed studies  cluster  models were developed by applying K Means to recognize patient  clusters  42 .  3.4.3.4. Artificial neural networks. Artificial neural network  ANN    based models are other computational approaches used to efficiently  solve classification problems. ANN prediction models developed in four  of the reviewed studies were MLP  multilayer perceptron  neural net  works with one  two  or three hidden layers  26 27 31 67 . Among  which two studies used ANN to predict the recovery and mortality status  of COVID 19 patients  26 27 . Banerjee et al.  2020  applied ANN to  identify SARS CoV 2 positive patients based on the results of their  complete blood count tests  31 . Mollalo et al.  2020  employed  multilayer perceptron  MLP  neural networks to model the COVID 19  incidence in the United States  67 .  3.4.3.5. Deep neural networks. The second most common type of pre  diction models deployed in 17 reviewed studies was deep learning  DL    based neural networks or DNNs  n  17   29 51 57 62 65 66 71 74 84   86 91 93 102 104 . All of which were convolution neural networks   CNN . Of the 17 CNN based studies  eight  47   and eight  47    studies developed these models to classify chest radiography images   29 62 65 71 73 91 92  and chest computed tomography  CT  images   51 57 66 74 86 93 102 104   respectively. Only one  6   study used  these models to classify lung ultrasonography  US  images as the data  source  84 .  3.4.3.6. Natural language processing  NLP .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100929 8models examined  there was only one study using NLP  47  to detect  off label medications that may be beneficial for the COVID 19  pandemic.  4.Discussion  This review study showed the applications of CI during the COVID   19 outbreak and identified current gaps in this field. Numerous studies  have been conducted to demonstrate the applications of clinical infor  matics in the treatment  detection  and control of COVID 19.  The literature search for published scientific papers helped us iden  tify a total of 72 relevant studies in this field. It was found that different  domains of CI are potentially useful in promoting the management and  control of the current COVID 19 pandemic.  Prediction models were the most helpful area for research on this  novel universal pandemic. To reduce the consequences of an epidemic  it  is necessary to appropriately control the epidemic in the early stages of  its emergence and take appropriate measures to prevent its transmission  to other countries in order to save many lives. Moreover  accurate pre  diction and monitoring of the disease transmission pattern could assist  officials in designing and implementing the required control programs   113 114 .  The second most popular area for research on COVID 19 was tele  health. Since the most distinctive feature of COVID 19 is its highly  communicable nature and rapid transmission  teleconsultation could  play a crucial role in preventing and controlling infection by creating  social distance. To prevent the transmission of COVID 19 to high risk  patients requiring clinical follow ups  routine healthcare interactions  could be performed via available teleconsultation platforms  115 .  During the COVID 19 pandemic  the use of telehealth has increased and  expanded to reduce the risk of the disease transfer by increasing social  distance and reducing direct contact. Moreover  it helps providers use  limited supplies for the most urgent cases  116 118 . Therefore  it is  necessary to discover the important applications of telehealth in  pandemics.  The last popular domain for research on COVID 19 was m health   which is one of the most appropriate methods that could be used to  manage COVID 19 by providing health services through tele visit  instead of patient physician direct contact as well as by fever coaching  and providing real time information about COVID 19. Due to the ad  vantages of using smart mobiles  such as cost effectiveness  simplicity   availability  and accessibility  the use of mHealth is recommended for  information exchange  119 .  Collecting information and data about COVID 19 plays an important  role in reducing the risk of its occurrence  120 . The information  gathered could be useful for possible outbreaks that may occur in the  future because the results of works done on previous pandemics are  useful for confronting the recent pandemic. Although clinical decision  support systems  CDSS  have become popular among healthcare pro  viders and clinical researchers  121   none of the included articles evaluated the use of CDSSs. Since the integration of CDSSs into clinical  practice is complex  122   it seems that the use of CDSS for COVID 19  requires more time.  Many of the reviewed studies had no risk of bias. The quality of the  methodology section varied significantly among the included studies.  Limited information on study design  main results  statistical analysis   and interpretation was the most important factor contributing to the low  scores of observational studies on the risk of bias. Only 25 studies ob  tained good quality scores in the methodology section  including five  observational studies and 22 prediction model studies. Lack of infor  mation on analysis  outcomes  and predictors was the most important  factor contributing to the low scores of this category on the risk of bias. A  remarkable risk of bias may affect the outcomes.  Strengths and Limitations  This review study examined the appli   cations of CI in the management and treatment of COVID 19. The pre  sent review addressed nearly all aspects of CI due to the use of the most  popular databases in medicine. Moreover  the quality of all studies was  thoroughly investigated using appropriate instruments based on the  type of each study. Finally  this study provided a comprehensive and  clear summary of observational and interventional studies.  This review study has several limitations. First  like all reviews  the  present review had limitations due to publication bias  for example   studies with significant results are more likely to be published than those  with insignificant results. Second  given that several studies have been  conducted and published over time on the COVID 19 pandemic  the  findings of this review could be considered as temporal effects of med  ical informatics tools. Third  other clinical informatics tools investigated  in unpublished studies were naturally excluded from this review.  Fourth  the results of some studies published in the form of letters to the  editor  editorials  short briefs  etc. were not included in this review.  The present research proposes some momentous directions for future  research. First  many of the reviewed articles on the topic provided no  qualitative and descriptive statistics. To promote the use of clinical  informatics  the exchange of experiences with others through providing  accurate qualitative and descriptive statistics is necessary and valuable.  Given that there was only one randomized controlled trial among the  reviewed studies  it is suggested that future investigators employ this  study design in their research and also take a step forward in applying  these tools in clinical practice  e.g. clinical decision support systems   computerized order entries  etc. . To improve patient care in crisis  conditions  it is necessary to develop clinical information systems that  are able to collect real time patient data. Furthermore  scoping reviews  could be conducted to describe and analyze other levels of medical  informatics  including bioinformatics  imaging informatics  and public  health informatics.  5.Conclusion  The present study showed CI applications during COVID 19 and  identified current gaps in this field.

The most common domains in CI for research on the COVID   19 crisis were prediction models and telehealth. It is suggested that  future researchers conduct scoping reviews to describe and analyze  other levels of medical informatics  including bioinformatics  imaging  informatics  and public health informatics.
