In this  respect  a personal health record  PHR  is one of the most important self care tools  which provides access to self   care services as well as chronic disease management  CDM  through monitoring and learning.  Methods  This applied developmental research was completed in three phases. The first phase was associated  with the minimum data set  MDS   including  A  finding relevant resources from the databases of PubMed   Google Scholar  Web of Science  Scopus  and Science Direct  as well as gray literature   B  extracting information  related to KTP health record  KTPHR    C  assessing the quality of studies via a rating checklist  and  D   designing an initial KTPHR model and its validation by the Delphi technique based on expert opinions. The  second phase also consisted of the development of a KTPHR app for Android. In the third phase  the KTPHR  usability was evaluated by think aloud and heuristics techniques.  Results  The study results comprised of  1  developing the MDS for KTPs with reference to a systematic method  and a scoring system  namely  10 classes and 80 data set elements   and  2  designing and building the KTPHR  app with features such as health records  data dashboard  test results  medications  appointments visits  and  training to prolong the life of a transplanted kidney  3   reflecting on usability evaluation outcomes to  demonstrate that qualitative evaluation was more reliable for identifying problems than quantitative heuristics.  In addition  utilizing the rating checklist revealed that the principles of  flexibility and efficiency of use  had a  higher severity than other cases  and the principle of  help users recognize  diagnose  and recover from errors   had a lower severity by itself.  Conclusion  The final KTPHR model was designed through reviewing the related literature  and validation by  clinical and basic science specialists to improve self care behaviors in KTPs  and consequently facilitate and  accelerate decision making by clinicians. Since the final KTPHR model met the main criteria for evaluation  purposes  including content validity and usability  it can be used with more confidence and reliability.    1.Introduction  Chronic conditions as the leading cause of disabilities and mortality  across the world  accounting for 75  of the burden of health care costs   1   and 71  of the global deaths  2  are drastically rising  1 3 4 . In  2002  the National Kidney Foundation  NKF  also defined disorders in  the functions and structure of the kidneys lasting for three months as chronic kidney disease  CKD   5 . Being characterized as an asymp   tomatic condition  CKD is known as the silent killer  so with the late  emergence of the disease symptoms  most patients go to see doctors at  the advanced stages when their kidneys have lost their functions  6 7 .  The NKF  s Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative  KDOQI   guidelines accordingly divide patients with CKD based on low stability  in the estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  into five stages  5     Corresponding author.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100930 2including a person with Stage 5 CKD at the end stage of the renal disease   ESRD  with the eGFR of 15 mL min or less. At this stage  the kidneys  have almost lost their functions and only need hemodialysis  HD  or  transplant therapy for their survival  8 . Studies have thus far shown  that transplant can lower the risk of heart disease in comparison with HD   4  and even the risk of death in kidney transplant recipients  KTRs   becomes lower in patients undergoing HD  therefore  kidney transplant  can be an appropriate elective therapy for ESRD patients  2 .  CKD and ESRD are correspondingly known as common health  problems  9  and worldwide public health challenges because of their  cost burden and limited financial resources  3 6 10 15   which are  prevalent not only in developed countries but also in developing nations  such as Iran with the low economy  13 14 16 . According to recent  studies  the number of patients with ESRD is unexpectedly growing  around the world above the annual human population growth at the  global scale  17 . CKD is also affecting approximately 10 13  of the  adult population in the world  18 19 . In Europe  the ESRD average  annual incidence rate is 171 cases per million  and such figures have  been reported by 100 and 336 per million in the United Kingdom and the  United States  respectively  20 . With reference to official reports  the  annual growth in the incidence rate of ESRD in Iran is equal to 11   and  evidence shows that the number of patients will double in the next five  years  21 . Moreover  the ESRD incidence and prevalence rates in this  country are 53 and 250 cases per million  respectively  22 . About 54   of ESRD patients in Iran are also undergoing hemodialysis  and the rest  experiences kidney transplants  23 . These estimates show that kidney  disease may be more prevalent than DM by 8.2   24 .  With reference to the reports released by the United States  US   National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion   NCCDPHP   multimorbidity is accompanied by cost burden  25 .  Therefore  following the rise in the prevalence rates of obesity  DM  and  HTN  the risk of kidney disease also increases  26 .  Studies have further shown that patients suffering from kidney dis  ease are facing numerous challenges in terms of self care  including  complex decision making  frequent hospitalizations  27   the manage   ment of blood pressure  weight  total cholesterol  and blood sugar  fluid  intake  diet changes  drug compliance  and physical activities. As  self care skills in such patients are at low levels  11   self care education  is a strategy to relieve kidney disease and one of the major goals for  public health  11 28   which may soon become part of primary care  services  25 .  Mobile technology is also extensively used for CDM services  12 .  Accordingly  apps developed for self care via mobiles can boost the ef  ficiency of some important tasks  affect care for CKD in a clinical  manner  and support patients  decisions in real time through algorithms  created in each behavioral component  29 . CDM  including the services  for KTPs  is thus primarily associated with the person  i.e.  it is  patient centered. Therefore  the necessity of self care in KTPs is evident   and some improvements in self care skills among patients suffering from  chronic conditions can definitely put an end to the numerous challenges  facing health systems.  Currently  Iran is implementing one of the most successful Kidney  transplant programs in the Middle East  30   so that its rate has reached  24 cases per million people  31 . The rates for liver and heart transplants  are 0.33 and 0.16 cases per million  respectively. Due to the success of  kidney transplantation and the increasing demand of patients for  transplantation  the waiting list has expanded rapidly. It is important to  note that there has been no waiting list in Iran since 1999  32 .  Most of the patients performed Renal Replacement Therapy RRT are  young. A review of existing study conducted the increasing future de  mands for such therapy in Iran  33 .  Providing help during self care for chronic conditions  particularly  CKD is thus possible through a PHR. This tool is extensively available  and comprehensible to people  34 35  as a lifelong resource of health  information in accordance with the definitions released by the National  Alliance for Health Information Technology  NAHIT  and the American Health Information Management Association  AHIMA   which can be  exploited for health related decision making  36   especially to aid  those actively involved in their self care  37 . Although there is no  single path toward a global PHR  the use of common data can be the  basic starting point  36 .  A PHR lays emphasis on patient empowerment and better patient   doctor interaction to improve health care quality as a reliable proced   ure to implement an electronic health record  EHR   which can boost  clinical decision making along with comprehensive data collection  38 .  PHR also has a large number of potential benefits  including viewing  patients  personal health information  reviewing laboratory test results   checking essential drug lists  browsing valid links to authentic health  information online  39 40   reducing doctors  workloads and health  care cost burden  41   improving health care relationships  39 40 42    relieving anxiety  increasing patient involvement  42   maintaining and  improving health care quality  42 43   identifying drug interactions  as  well as documenting allergies and controlling drug and food regimens   39 44 . There are also simpler benefits  including appointments and  prescriptions  40 .  Moreover  a PHR can take account of the features of decision sup  port  which can be effective in the management of patients with chronic  conditions  45 . The remarkable thing is that all the benefits of the use of  a PHR for health care providers depend on the integrity of PHR and EHR   45 .  With regard to upgrading paper based PHR into electronic ones   there is a consensus that the digitization of health records can help retain  information over time  and such information consequently leads to  improved availability of health services and their consequences  46 .  Therefore  a PHR is currently computer based. In the future  smart   phones  personal digital assistants  PDAs   iPods  and other web based  devices can host PHRs in complete or partial manners  46 .  Mobile based PHR  mPHR  can thus provide patients with the pos  sibility of having access to health information via the Internet or remote  devices  including PDAs and mobiles  in particular  smartphones or  those with a system with the capability to run common user apps . The  growing use of mPHRs among patients also indicates some extensive  trends in digitalized health care to raise the popularity of medical  mobile based apps. The mPHRs are quickly on the rise to share infor  mation  47 .  The minimum data set  MDS   known as one of the emerging tools for  data collection purposes  provides accurate access to health data and  statistics  48 . As well  designing and implementing the MDS in health  care institutions is a preliminary stage of disease information manage   ment that can lead to improved quality of care and disease control  48 .  The MDS is further defined as an essentially appropriate set of po  tential data elements to pave the grounds for planning  managing  and  evaluating performance. The main goal of all MDSs  as the core elements  of health data and statistics  is to ensure that the data can be compared  and matched  using standardized data items with the same definitions.  The evaluation of information systems accordingly aims to deter   mine some components  such as user satisfaction  cost effectiveness   usability  strengths and weaknesses  and even guidance to upgrade the  use of these systems  49 . Thus  one of the methods to boost the confi   dence level and efficiency of such health information systems is their  evaluation  as the main element at the first stages of their development   50 .  The categories suggested thus far to perform such evaluations are  user centered and heuristic  expert centered  ones. During the user   centered evaluation process  users normally perform some tasks  and  then their interactions with the application are observed and recorded  on video. Most of such evaluations are done through video analysis. In  addition  user feedback is generally provided with several question   naires and interviews. On the other hand  heuristics is assumed as an  indirect  low cost  simple  and expert centered evaluation  in which  experts explore the compatibility of the interface elements of a system  with reference to a set of principles  called evaluation principles  51 .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100930 3Therefore  the heuristic type of evaluation is among the methods that  help identify usability problems by spending less time and cost  and  exploiting even few resources  52 . Therefore  it is more useful and  efficient  51 .  The researchers in the present study are accordingly to design and  evaluate an mPHR for KTPs.  2.Methods  This study was conducted in three phases as follows   The first phase was associated with designing the MDS based on the  following steps    A  Searching strategy and screening  Initially  the search strategy was developed based on some keywords   Tables 1 and 2   and the researchers looked for the related resources  accordingly. All the retrieved outputs were then transferred to the  EndNote  as the main reference management tool. Searching the existing  resources through the databases of PubMed  Web of Science  Scopus   Science Direct  and Google Scholar  wherein the researchers adopted a  two stage procedure to identify the studies on for KTPHRs. At the first  stage  the above mentioned databases were searched to identify the  articles related to KTPHR  and at the second stage  gray literature  i.e.   reports  standards  and guidelines published by related centers and as  sociations were searched using the Google search engine in order to  avoid the neglect of dozens of possible relevant studies. It should be  noted that no time limits were considered to include all articles on  KTPHR. In addition  non English studies were excluded.   B  Extracting data elements related to KTPHR The eligible study data were extracted by the researchers  and then  the essential information items related to the KTPHRs  including infor  mation item and source type were obtained. The information item was  thus effective in identifying some items such as BUN  Cr  etc.  and the  source type could help in assigning the value or score to each data  element.   C  Confirming article quality  using a rating checklist with reference  to the study entitled  Diabetic personal health record  A sys  tematic review article   53   the selected studies were evaluated.  The details are listed in Table 3. In this sense  the articles  ac  cording to the study type  were scored 1 to 4  and then rated. All  the studies included in this review were thus checked. Of note   the quality score was given by one of the researchers and the  second researcher consequently validated them.   D  Designing the initial KTPHR model and its validation  which was  fulfilled using content validity ratio  CVR  and content validity  index  CVI   with the help of experts as well as medical infor  matics and health information technology specialists. At the end   the data elements obtaining the highest scores in the final KTPHR  model were selected.  The second phase was associated with designing the mobile based  KTPHR app  which was done by an app professional designer within  approximately one to two months. KTPHR app was coded through Java  programing language. Its operating system was Android. In order to  complete the KTPHR development  about eight online and in person  meetings were further held. The KTPHR interface could also support  the patient centered type.  In the third phase  the KTPHR usability was evaluated as follows    1. KTPHR evaluation by usability heuristics  In this type of evaluation  the app was provided to 20 evaluators   including nephrologists  one person   health informatics and health in  formation management specialists  17 cases   and laboratory specialists   two individuals    2. KTPHR usability evaluation based on Think Aloud Protocol  TAP   In this user centered evaluation process  the app was provided to ten  patients who had undergone kidney transplants. They accordingly per  formed some typical tasks in the form of a scenario described by the  research team  in such a way that the app had been installed on their  smartphones  and then received some explanations as a scenario.

All  the tasks took place in a completely quiet environment. During the tasks   the users were also filmed  and at the end  all the recorded sounds and  videos were analyzed. In order to reflect on why and how users oper  ated  their feedback during the tasks were examined in the form of in  terviews and focus group meetings  and subsequently utilized to modify  and upgrade the app. As a result  these findings were investigated to  provide some recommendations for the app redesign. The inclusion  criteria for the patients to evaluate the app usability by TAP were both  genders  the age range between 20 and 60  convenient ones  residency in  the city of Ahvaz  access to smartphones  and holding at least a high  school graduate.  3.Results  3.1. The first phase results  Designing the MDS of KTPHR  Among the studies retrieved in the literature review  only 36 re  sources were selected. In order to determine the PHR structure  the data  classes and sub classes of the existing resources were further extracted  and then allocated to proper categories with reference to the scoring  system.  Thereafter  the guidelines published by nephrology and kidney  transplant associations  articles  and resources were checked to deter   mine the KTPHR structure  complete the main factors required by the  patients in the target population based on the PHR classes  and reach the  same structure for designing the KTPHR model. In the end  the KTPHR  model was designed by the review of the related studies and evidence   and almost eight 2 h meetings  along with confirmation by the super   visor and a nephrologist.  The KTPHR model was then given to clinical and non clinical experts  in the form of a questionnaire to assess its validity.  The frequency of the general characteristics of the clinical and basic  science specialists  validating the KTPHR questionnaire  is illustrated in  Table  4 .  Ultimately  upon a review of the questionnaires  the KTPHR model  was designed. With regard to the content of the studies included and  based on the CVR obtained  11 main classes of KTPHR were determined.  The details associated with the use of these classes  the number of data  items  and the number of the items selected  are provided in Table 5.  The data items related to each class together with their references  and scores based on the total values of the evidence are shown in  Table 6.  The data elements for the final KTPHR model are illustrated in  Table 7. 4.The second phase results  App development  Mobile based KTPHR App Features.  The KTPHR was a mobile based app to help KTPs manage their  health information and self care. The data for this app was provided by a  review of valid resources such as articles  reports  standards published  by international centers and associations. To sum up  the features of the  KTPHR app were delineated as follows     Emergency contacts  The contact details of patients   close family    Medical staff information  The contact details of doctors and other  medical staff required by patients    Health records  The list of all present conditions and patients   history  of diseases and allergies    Home monitoring  Recording BS  blood pressure  height  and weight   as well as water intake and urine output    Medications  The list of drugs taken by patients and their  descriptions    Tests  Patients   laboratory test data registration including their  normal and abnormal ranges    Vaccines  Data registration for patients   required vaccines    Appointments  Patients   appointments including previous and next  ones and doctors   recommendations   Lifestyle  Data related to exercise  diet  smoking cessation  and life  style modifications  Accordingly  the patients could improve their self awareness and  self care  and even become empowered to cooperate with doctors to  manage their disease.  Before designing the app  a needs analysis was conducted based on  the questionnaire whose validity was confirmed in the previous step.  Then  the first version of the model with the features concerned was  verified by the project supervisor in the form of a prototype at several  steps based on some considerations and certain validations. Of note  the  researchers attempted to have proper validations for each field in view  of the type of input data design and prevent any input data entry errors.  5.The third phase results  usability evaluation of KTPHR app   1. App Evaluation by the Usability Heuristics Method  In evaluating the KTPHR app usability by the heuristic method   combined evaluation  qualitative and quantitative  was performed. Of  note  qualitative evaluation is used for specialists with sufficient skills in  evaluation  and ability to define problems and match them with heu  ristic principles.  Checklist evaluation is also utilized for those who plan to check some  examples listed in the checklist based on Nielsen  s 10 main principles  with the problems in the app.  For this study  Nielsen  s 10 main principles  Table 8  were utilized Table 4  The frequency of clinical and basic science specialists validating the KTPHR  questionnaire in terms of their general characteristics.

In addition  they  weighed the severity of the problems based on the five point scale in  Table 9  52 .  The general characteristics of the basic science specialists validating  the KTPHR usability heuristic evaluation are listed in Table 10.  During the quantitative evaluation  the app was examined by nine  evaluators  using the exploratory evaluation principles in Table 8. Accordingly  a total number of 177 usability problems  as the sum of the  defined ones in Table 11  were identified. In this sense  two problems  were common among eight  seven  and six evaluators  six cases had  commonalities among five evaluators  eight problems were shared  among four evaluators  five cases were common among three evaluators   and sixteen problems had commonalities between two evaluators. Upon  merging the common cases  the total number of the problems reduced to  65.

More than 50  of the discrepancies were about the principles of   help users recognize  diagnose  and recover from errors    consistency  and standards   and  user control and freedom .  The mean severity of the problems identified here ranged from 1.5   small  related to the principle of  match between system and the real  world  to 2.7  large  associated with the principle of  flexibility and  efficiency of use . The following is a classification of the usability  problems based on the non compliance principles  Table 11 . Finally   the problems identified by the independent evaluators were combined   and the duplicates were removed. They were then summarized in a  single list and their mean severity was calculated. In addition  the  commonalities of the identified problems among different evaluators  were determined.  In the qualitative evaluation  the app was examined by seven eval  uators. A total number of 62 usability problems were identified  and as  before  the problems identified by the independent evaluators were  combined and collected after removing the duplicates. Each instance  was then assigned to one of Nielsen  s 10 main principles.

Therefore  after merging the common cases  their total  number reduced to 54. In this evaluation  the lowest non compliance  with the principles of usability evaluation in the KTPHR app was  related to the principle of  help users recognize  diagnose  and recover  from errors  and  aesthetic and minimalist design   1 case  2    and the  most was associated with the principle of  visibility of system status   24  cases  44  . More than 50  of the discrepancies were related to the  principles of  visibility of system status  and  consistency and standards.   As depicted in Table 13  six problems were identified in the usability  evaluation of the TPHR app by a laboratory specialists.  6.App Evaluation of by TAP  To evaluate the KTPHR app usability  10 people participated  two of  whom were female  and three people were male. Considering the level of  education  two cases were holding a bachelor s degree  two had a high  school graduate  and one was holding a master s degree. The mean age  of the patients was 37 and the mean evaluation sessions were 16 min.  The general characteristics of the KTPs participating in the evaluation of  the KTPHR app usability are shown in Table 14.  7.Discussion  Initial research also showed that KTPs  data collection has not been  so far done in an organized and standardized manner. Accordingly  this  study was the first attempt  to the best of the authors  knowledge  to  develop a KTPHR model in Iran. Since there was no standard case in  Iran  a review of evidence including articles  international reports   standards  and guidelines was completed to prepare the initial KTPHR  model. Over recent decades  the use of PHR is rapidly expanding.  From AHIMA s perspective  developing a common dataset can be a  starting point although there is no single path to global PHR  90 . In this  study  evidence related to the data elements of KTPHR was thus checked  and the results were validated by clinical experts. The present study was  the first attempt with a more comprehensive MDS in Iran  to the best of  the authors  knowledge.  Iran is one of the countries with the highest number of kidney  transplants in the Middle East  91 . To have the optimal management of  a kidney transplant  the data were further organized using a standard  procedure. The validation of the findings obtained from a review of the  evidence in accordance with the scoring system by Azizi et al. was  accordingly suggested  53 .  The evidence of the review results showed a wide variety of data  classes in the final model  including general data  medical staff data   emergency contact data  home measurement data  laboratory test data   medication data  clinical data  vaccination data  lifestyle data  and  others. Among the mentioned data classes  lifestyle and general data had  received the most and the least citations  respectively. In addition to the  gender data items  date of birth and address  general data   medical staff  data  emergency contact data  blood pressure  fasting BS  and BMI   home monitoring   Cr  HbA1c  HDL  laboratory test data   drug dosage  and description  medication data   allergy and treatment outcomes   clinical data   influenza and hepatitis B vaccine  vaccination data   and  diet  lifestyle data  had been mostly cited. While patient s image and  place of birth  general data   medical staff data  emergency contact data   water intake and urination  home monitoring   Na  K  and pyuria  lab  oratory test data   brand name and drug form  medication data    comorbidities  clinical data   HCV and CMV vaccine  vaccination data    and exercise  lifestyle data  were the least cited. According to the re  searchers  no similar study was found for comparison purposes.  A review and comparison of the MDS in the initial KTPHR model and  the one derived from clinical and non clinical experts  opinions also  resulted in striking findings. This review demonstrated that the data  elements derived from the evidence were closely associated with non   clinical experts  opinions and overlapped with the MDS  but the MDS Table 11  KTPHR usability problems by their commonality among evaluators  and their mean severity according to the quantitative heuristic evaluation method  checklist .

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100930 9elements obtained from studies and evidence were in conflict with  clinical experts   opinions. Of note  the data elements of water intake and  urine output  home monitoring  had the least citations  but they were  placed in the MDS in the final model as advocated by clinical experts.  Moreover  the researchers considered this paradox coming from expert  opinions  native to Khuzestan Province  Iran  due to its weather condi   tions and climate.  The validation results also indicated that the majority of the data  items related to nine data classes were important and very important as  stated by clinical experts. Moreover  there were items  which had been  less cited but had been assumed important in expert opinions  therefore   their comments were of a top priority compared with other validations.  Comparing both evaluation methods  the researchers concluded that  qualitative evaluation was more reliable in identifying problems. As  well  women could identify more problems than men. Using the  checklist evaluation  only three problems  minimum number  in the  principle of  flexibility and efficiency of use  were identified by nine  evaluators  but due to the high weight of severity  the problems were  assumed greater than others. Moreover  in the principle of  help users  recognize  diagnose  and recover from errors   eleven problems were identified  maximum number   but it had a smaller severity by itself due  to the low weight of severity.  The study results suggested a model for KTPHR tools to involve pa  tients in their self care process. First  the most important information  elements required by the KTPHR tool to improve self care activities  related to KTPs were identified  and then evaluated from the perspective  of patients and specialists as well as medical staff  which is a challenge to  them.  Self care behaviors refer to decisions and activities by a person to  deal with a health issue or promote health status. There are numerous  self care models  whose common feature is that patients are placed at  the heart of health management. As a whole  the large number of KTPs   particularly young ones  highlights the importance of self care for this  age group.  The results of this study implied the positive influence of this app on  the literacy of KTPs as well as their self care. Overall  self care was  examined from several perspectives  including distinguishing normal  data from abnormal ones based on all colors and warnings  changing  information based on time intervals  providing information about pre  vious measurement values  and giving information regarding the history  of measurement date and time.  Few studies have been thus far conducted in relation to PHR and self   care. The important thing originates from different aspects of self care in  various investigations. Most studies have so far reflected on the positive  effects of PHR  although some have not noted such effects  92 . There   fore  researchers have shown that such controversies might have several  reasons  more importantly  app design methods  research designs  and  study times. Consequently  the results of these studies have been  affected by some limitations and biases. Since there were few studies on  PHR and KTPs  a systemic review of the effectiveness of PHR in KTPs can  be useful.  Research strengths   1.

Informatics in Medicine Unlocked 30  2022  100930 10technology in mobile based interventions can be usually very effec  tive in recruiting patients. Younger people with digital literacy and  those with Internet access also tend to participate in such studies.  This study was no exception. Such a tendency could lead to biases in  the findings  therefore  this study did not report the actual distribu   tion of the statistical population.   3. Given the nature of the study  the researchers repeatedly requested  the patients to participate in the study to review the app  which  reduced their desire to contribute to this research. To address such  issues  some financial incentives  such as free laboratory tests and  appointment fees  were used.  Conclusion and suggestions  Considering the review of evidence and validations by clinical and  non clinical experts  the final KTPHR model was developed to improve  self care skills in KTPs. However  to help KTPs benefit from KTPHR  this  tool was implemented and evaluated on these patients after frequent  modifications of the user interface via usability techniques.  Future studies are thus suggested to evaluate this tool in a large scale  manner in health care centers. In addition  this app can be utilized for  other patients under the CKD category. Moreover  the present study  methods and the results can provide the grounds for similar research  with different topics  aimed at promoting self care in patients using web   or mobile based tools.
