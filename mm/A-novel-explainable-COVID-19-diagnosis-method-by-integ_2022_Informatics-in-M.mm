Contrary to these previous models  a model based  on Ensemble Learning is developed in this study. 5 Though decision forest has a high level of prediction performance  its  inherent limitations cannot be hidden as well.

The aim of the next step is to score different factors  of COVID 19 diagnosis by employing a feature ranking technique. In the  third step  to select non redundant and relevant features  those of high  scores and dissimilar feature are chosen using a novel feature selection  strategy  while the remaining features are removed. Finally  in fourth  step  an Explainable Random Forest based classifier is used to diagnosis  COVID 19 cases considering the selected features on the previous steps. This developed explainable prediction model has two main phases   the feature section  i.e.  1 3 steps  and the developed explainable  random forest predication model  i.e.  4 step . In the first phase  the  features of COVID 19 data are illustrated by a graph and a set of relevant  and non redundant of initial features is selected for final diagnosis  phase  and then in the second phase  a novel approach to increase the  interpretability of the random forest based predictions is used and an  effective artificial intelligence based predictor for COVID 19 disease  diagnosis is developed using routine blood tests.

      <node TEXT="If  these two features are very similar  the Pearson criterion will be close to  one  while if these two features are very dissimilar  the Pearson criterion  will be close to zero. Therefore  removing both irrelevant and redundant  features is achieved by the proposed method. The Fisher Score scores feature ac  cording to their predictive and discriminatory power. Furthermore  in our developed feature selection method  as opposed  to previous models  84 86  where only feature relevance is employed to  select final features  a subset of features with high importance and rel  evancy will be chosen. Specifically  all features are sorted according to their Feature  Importance  FI  scores. The  recursive process repeats itself until no further division is necessary.
