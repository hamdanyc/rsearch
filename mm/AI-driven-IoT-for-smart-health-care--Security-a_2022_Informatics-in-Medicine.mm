By  applying this parallel  it can be inferred that even if the data transmitted  by a given endpoint device might not result in any issue related to pri  vacy  per se  the amount of data that is accumulated from different de  vices can also create some types of privacy problems  10 . Choi et al. illustrated the IoT com  ponents  respective vulnerabilities and threat attack type  as summarized in Table 1. A good example to explain such privacy breaches  includes the case of a group of insurance commissions in Massachusetts   which bought health insurance for state employees and released records  for every hospital visit by the state employees at no cost to any scholar  who wanted such data  13 . It is important to demonstrate that a  serious privacy breach of AOL search data did occur when AOLs released  more than 20 million search enquiries using the internet to engage more  academic scholars. The main goal of such technology is to provide a type of custom   ized discount in real time for each individual customer based on how she  is feeling and again reviewing her individual purchase history as well as  preferences. The automated identification of people from a type of  digital image or even a video frame is already being used by the agencies Table 1  IoT components  vulnerabilities and threat attack types in IoT health care  applications." />

      <node TEXT="Integrating AI driven IoT features into  individual medical devices tends to improve the quality and effective   ness of the specific service offered  this approach tends to be very  valuable for individual patients who have any form of chronic condi   tions  elderly individuals  and those who require continuous care. It is very common to witness AI driven IoT devices in rooms of  patients  electronic medical records  and other cloud based resources. It includes several  types of equipment that are seen at the bedside within hospitals  such as  EKG monitors. This area has continued to expand  with present in  novations occurring across the world of AI driven IoT. Treatments that patients receive are enhanced by remote monitoring  and communication  areas within which the AI driven IoT can play a  very large role  11 . In the future   such data rich personalized analysis of individual health will be an  excellent standard. For example  toward the end of 2018  two security scholars discovered  more than sixty eight thousand medical systems that had been exposed  Fig." />

      <node TEXT="To outline the type of security  privacy  and trust measures that  should be taken when applying AI driven IoT  AIIoT  for smart  health care systems. According to Smith et al.  5   a vast amount  of information has been archived over the years. Each article was generated by first  entering relevant keywords into databases within computer systems. The researcher made a search of different peer reviewed articles from  various databases  which included Google Scholar  EBSCOhost  ERIC   and Academic OneFile. Words such as  Information Security Culture     privacy     AI   driven IoT   and  Smart health care  were used in the search process. It is essential to mention that  categorical analysis involves coding as well as sorting out of data into  categories that had already been established  while the holistic  approach  on the other hand  involves given programs  situations  and  experiences. While Tealab  9  argues that ethnographers can always  gather data through artifacts  interviews  and physical observation  the  qualitative data used in this paper mainly came from documents and  systematic reviews of existing scholarly literature." />
