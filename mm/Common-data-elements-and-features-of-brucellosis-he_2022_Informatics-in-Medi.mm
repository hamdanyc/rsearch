Methods  A two step process  including an extensive literature search and a two round Delphi survey  was per  formed to foster consensus about the required data items. Results  The final MDS platform of our study contained 134 items divided into five main categories of admin   istrative information  epidemiology  diagnosis investigation  complications  and signs and symptoms. According to the  World Health Organization  WHO   more than 500 000 new cases of  brucellosis are annually reported worldwide  4 . Timely and responsive public health surveillance for zoonotic dis  eases such as brucellosis heavily depends on integrated interventions  from public health settings  hospitals  and animal related organizations. These interventions necessitate a consistent  reliable  and interoperable  dataset across involved organizations  8 9 .

In another  study  Shanbehzadeh et al.  2022  designed a standard and customized  reporting template to provide interoperability between zoonotic dis  eases information systems  ZDISs  in Iran. Dong et al. reported that a standard brucellosis reporting template  improves data integrity  interoperability  accuracy  and reusability for  the patient care process  care quality  and research  55 . Rodr guez et al. also developed a hospitalization minimum data set  CMBD  to stan  dardize the documentation of brucellosis data in two clinical and  non clinical sections and seven data elements  including age  sex  the  type of residence  admission type  discharge type  length of stay  LOS    and cause of hospitalization  56 . Moreover  Moradi et al. designed the  structure and content of the national brucellosis surveillance system for  Iran s electronic health  e health  system to improve epidemiological  studies and clinical research.

      <node TEXT="In contrast  a  structured MDS can provide a fruitful source to collect data features that  potentially affect the outcomes and allow for multivariable analysis to  determine the primary predictors of interest  particularly when these  variables are uniformly defined and collected  59 . Further extensions and modifications are essential  thus  conducting  an experimental study by including a supplementary Delphi phase to  improve the dataset is recommended. Furthermore  this dataset can collect generalizable variables  from multi center organizations and lay the basis for conducting an  exhaustive analysis based on machine learning  ML  methods about  many aspects of brucellosis. An experimental study including a further Del  phi step before implementation is advisable to refine some data  categories. The protocol includes information regarding  funding  sponsors  funded   institutional affiliations  potential conflicts  of interest  incentives for subjects  and information regarding provisions  for treating and or compensating subjects who are harmed as a conse   quence of participation in the research study.
