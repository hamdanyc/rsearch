      <node TEXT="Methods  A comprehensive search was performed on Medline and Scopus databases in September 2020. Results  In this review study  72 out of 2716 retrieved articles met the inclusion criteria for full text analysis. Most of the studies in telehealth domain used synchronous methods  such as online and phone  or video call  consultations. Conclusion  The present study showed clinical informatics applications during COVID 19 and identified current  gaps in this field. It is suggested that future researchers conduct scoping  reviews to describe and analyze other levels of medical informatics  including bioinformatics  imaging infor  matics  and public health informatics.
