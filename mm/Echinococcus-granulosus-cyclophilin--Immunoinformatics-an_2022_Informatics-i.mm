      <node TEXT="Protein protein docking between EgCyc and HLA DR receptor  For this purpose  the PDB file of HLA DR receptor was obtained from  the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics  RCSB  data  base  42   under PDB ID of 6NIX. The speculated pI of EgCyc protein was estimated to be relatively  acidic in nature  6.41 . Relatively equal number of positively   Arg   Lys  and negatively charged  Asp  Glu  residues were predicted for the  protein  17 vs 18 . The EgCyc protein was  shown to be highly stable  having instability index of 12.19. In a similar  manner  combined prediction approach employed by the AlgPred web  server showed allergenicity for EgCyc protein. The PDB file of this model was selected  for further rehashing and validation procedures. This model was ob  tained from template 4hy7.1.A  monomer  with high coverage and  sequence identity of 70.81 ." />

The output  showed that this protein possesses 162 residues with a 17.35 kDa mo  lecular weight  suggesting adequate antigenicity  it is said that proteins  having a molecular weight below 5 10 kDa are considered as poor im  munogens  7 39 . Also  the protein was rendered as relatively acidic   with a pI of 6.41. Instability index of this protein was calculated to be  12.19  indicating a highly stable molecule. In this study  we applied  several methods and web tools to predict B  and T cell epitopes of EgCyc  protein to achieve the highest accuracy in prediction. For the identifi   cation of continuous B cell epitopes  Bcepred  IEDB  and ABCpred online  servers were utilized.
