Subsequently  Gal  axyRefine server was employed to refine the most suitable 3D model   relied on a CASP10 tested refinement method  https   galaxy.seoklab. The ABCpred web server depends on an artificial neural network  ANN   method for the prediction  http   crdd.osdd.net raghava abcpred      37   while B cell tool of IEDB server predicts B cell epitopes  BepiPred   along with beta turn  flexibility  antigenicity  hydrophilicity and surface  accessibility in a graphical manner  http   tools.iedb.org bcell   ." />

In this sense  115   87.1    15  11.4    2  1.5   and 0  0.0   of residues in crude model  were allocated to the most favored  additional favored  generously  Fig. 3.Prediction of phosphorylation sites of the EgCyc protein using NetPhos web server suggested 14 putative regions." />
