      <node TEXT="The polygon vertices are used to  compute binary masks for each delineated ROI. In case of imperfect registration or asymmetrical  anatomy  both ROIs may be modified interactively after initial drawing. We hypothesize that normal  unrestricted  and healthy  perfusion to a single artery sourced angiosome  29  follows during  thermal recovery  with a time constant proportional to the vasculari   zation and perfusion of the area." />

Freeware and open source  programs for medical thermal imaging are severely lacking  thus as a completely open source project IRlab offers  a unique platform for researchers within the field of medical thermal imaging. All of these methods require patient contact and do  not offer spatial information apart from a single measurement point." />
