      <node TEXT="Bag of words features extraction techniques with SVM slightly out  performed TF IDF in the augmented subsets. Thus  the frequency of any given word in those not indicated re  ferrals increased in the corpus and made some difficulties to TF IDF to  discriminate those words. Focusing only on the  CNN DA model  this study has more similarities with  26   who devel   oped a CNN model with Glove pre trained vector embedding to binary  classify CT reports as positive or negative for the presence of pulmonary embolism. However  in their study  a larger  dataset comprising 2500 reports was used for training  whereas in this  study  the training set  after augmentation  included 1061 referrals  and  as it is known that deep neural models tend to require more data to show  good performance  25 . Fasttext is  suitable for handling out of vocabulary words  OOV   as commonly exist  in medical texts. Although not satisfactory  these findings indicate  that Bi LSTM might be better than CNN in binary classification tasks  with imbalanced datasets  especially if the focus is to classify the mi  nority class correctly. SVM BoW DA demonstrated the second highest performance  with accuracy  0.84  F1  0.90 and correct classification of 12 not  indicated referrals." />
