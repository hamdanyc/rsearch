      <node TEXT="Readmission  imposes additional costs on care organizations and patients. Ac  cording to the formal reports  about 5  of COVID 19 confirmed patients  necessitate hospitalization care services  and the tolls of readmission  from this disease report vary from 2 to 10   14 15 . CDSSs using  available patient data at the time of admission may provide caregivers  with valuable information regarding the likelihood risk of COVID 19  readmission  20 21 . Recently  published works have shown that several ML methods are  more accurate than conventional statistics models for predicting clinical  outcomes in COVID 19 hospitalized patients. They are such as predict   ing the Length of Stay  LOS   hospital bed occupancy and turnover   Intensive Care Unit  ICU  admission  and respiratory intubation   25 27 . Therefore  the present  study seeks to answer two questions. This study used Python programming language to run all experiments on  the data mining algorithms to predict readmission in patients with  confirmed COVID 19  see Fig." />

      <node TEXT="Table 1 indicated that there  was a significant association between some features of patients who  readmitted or not  features with p value D0.005 that showed in Table 1  with     symbol  have a significant difference in patients who read  mitted d or not class. For example  the results showed that there was a  significant relationship between ICU admission and COVID status with  readmission  p value D0.002  and  p value D0.001   respectively. Based on Table 2  COVID 19 status  ICU admission  and oxygen  therapy obtain the highest score for the prediction of readmission in a  patient with COVID 19. Moreover  age and solid metastatic tumor have  a low score in relevant variables scores  so it means that age and solid  metastatic tumor have a low impact on the prediction of readmission in  confirmed COVID 19 patients. After the  preprocessing step  several ML modeling was performed by adjusting  and optimizing hyper parameters.
