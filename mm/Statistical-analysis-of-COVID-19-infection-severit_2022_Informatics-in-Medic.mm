      <node TEXT="In  this study  we used a deep learning model with U Net architecture to segment the lung lobes from the source  19   which showed a promising  result quite similar to manual labeling. Most statistical studies to evaluate the severity of infection seek to  find a link between CT findings and clinical and laboratory attributes   but due to small available populations  generalization of the results is  often limited. In a study in 2020  using  Pearson  s correlation test and  multivariate analysis curves have yielded a score of relationship be  tween patients   clinical findings  examining tests  and chest CT images." />
      <node TEXT="In the pro  posed SVM model  we used a nonlinear radial basis function  RBF   kernel. Finally  by utilizing a SVM model  we predicted the  severity of infection in all five lung lobes. 4 suggests a significant difference between PDF of infection in  tensities for five lung lobes separately  demonstrating that our proposed  method can provide adequate differentiation between different config   urations of the infections per lobe." />
      <node TEXT="To segment the lung lobes  we used a pre trained U Net model with an average Dice  similarity coefficient  DSC  greater than 0.96. The introduced model can be used to generate a systematic automated report for  individual patients infected by COVID 19. Many  studies have reported a higher sensitivity for evaluations based on  computed tomography  CT  than RT PCR test  4 ." />
      <node TEXT="Bin Li et al.  26  presented a method for segmentation of  ground glass opacity  GGO  and juxta vascular nodules that showed  weak edges with inhomogeneous intensity characteristic. We observed that the pixel values  above  800 in normal lungs were associated with pulmonary arteries. Finally   using deep learning models directly on image data is also associated  with many challenges." />
