Since zoonoses affect both human and animal populations  it is  presumed that their surveillance should  at least for some purposes   target both populations and integrate the collected data among them  3   17 18 . Moreover  given that human and animal health are closely  interrelated and the costs of assembling new data are high  the inte  gration and reuse of these routinely collected data might be useful for  improving the surveillance of zoonoses  19 20 . This type of surveil   lance can be referred to as one health  OH  surveillance. In this sense  a consistent minimum dataset  MDS  is  one of the key steps in establishing a collaborative surveillance system  across organizations to increase inter sectional and scientific collabo   rations  33 36 .
