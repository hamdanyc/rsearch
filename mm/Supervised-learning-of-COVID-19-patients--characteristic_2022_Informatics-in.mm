      <node TEXT="Processing  In this stage  we train and test classification models using pre  processed data. In the literature  researchers have proposed many ma  chine learning approaches for different artificial intelligence  applications. These learning models include decision tree  SVM   KNN  logistic regression  and random forest due to their low time  complexity and high efficiency in classifying relational data. In other words   association analysis is the study of features or characteristics that are  related to each other and tries to extract rules from these features. Each subset of I is called a  transaction  denoted by T  and D is the set of transactions in T. Then an  association rule is shown as follows   X Y  Support  Confidence  So that  X I   Y  I   X Y   . Support  Indicates the percentage or number of D transactions that  include both X and Y. Many algorithms have been proposed to extract strong rules in the  literature." />

First  the classification performance metrics are computed in  detail for each classification algorithm and compared with the results of  previous studies.

Accordingly  our data suffered from a class imbalanced  problem  which can affect learning models. 2 represents the intubation   hospital section  blood oxygen level  and class label variables of some  patients toward their age. 3 shows the rate of  change in intubation  hospital ward  blood oxygen level  ratePo2   and class label  death  characteristics for 50 COVID 19 cases. Additionally  preprocessing steps may require  data sampling and normalization based on the learning method. The most well known methods for  picking out features are Filter  Wrappers  and Embedded procedures   48 .

      <node TEXT="Association rules results  In this study  we used association rules mining by the Apriori algo  rithm to identify a set of symptoms that determine the outcome of  COVID 19 patients with high confidence  0.9  and support  0.3 . 11 shows  the oxygen level with  intervals  1  1.5  plays a substantial role in various rules. Naturally  the rules  indicate that intervals  1.5 2  are necessary for patients to recover  because they do not need artificial respiration. Finally  it is principal to note that the extracted rules are one sided. It  means that although a combination of properties can result in the pa  tient  s recovery with high confidence  a patient may have recovered but  not meet any of the conditions set out in Fig. Random forest is an ensemble classification method based on the  majority vote and uses a combination of decision trees to classify data  classes. Although it has a higher computational complexity  past re  searches show that this classifier performs more beneficial than other  classification models due to its ensemble nature." />
