Besides   Famiglini  2021  compared three DT classifiers   performance based on  4995 CBC tests to predict ICU admission in COVID 19 patients. Early identification of  at risk patients may potentially reduce the need for imminent ICU beds  and invasive mechanical ventilators. First   because of analyzing a single center and retrospective database  we  were not able to include even more patients in the analysis. However   the used dataset was collected at Ayatollah Talleghani Hospital that  delivered only special care to COVID 19 patients. 4 Lechien JR  Chiesa Estomba CM  Place S  Van Laethem Y  Cabaraux P  Mat Q  et al.

ML prediction models  create remarkable opportunities to identify the most involved factors  and best decisions about each situation. This study aimed to develop prediction models for estimating ICU hospitalization among COVID 19  patients based on data that are easily obtained at the first time of  admission. For this purpose  seven DT methods  including DS  HT  LMT   J 48  RF  RT and REP tree  were trained using 512 de identified case  records of COVID 19 in hospital patients. Features of interest  This single center retrospective study  first  determines and ranks  contributing predictors affecting ICU admission. Selecting reliable and  clinically relevant predictors related to COVID 19 patients could help  improve the accuracy of prediction models. So  they were selected as the most  contributing factor in predicting COVID 19 ICU admission." />

COVID 19 patients with the underlining diseases  such as hypertension  27   diabetes  28   cancer  29  and lung diseases   30  were considered to be susceptible to having poor prognosis.
