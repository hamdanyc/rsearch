      <node TEXT="ML prediction models  create remarkable opportunities to identify the most involved factors  and best decisions about each situation. This study aimed to develop prediction models for estimating ICU hospitalization among COVID 19  patients based on data that are easily obtained at the first time of  admission. For this purpose  seven DT methods  including DS  HT  LMT   J 48  RF  RT and REP tree  were trained using 512 de identified case  records of COVID 19 in hospital patients." />

To predict  disease progression  patient condition deterioration  need for ICU hos  pitalization and intubation risk  previous studies have employed mul  tiple supervised ML models  including artificial neural networks  ANNs    DT  support vector machine  SVM   random forest  RF  and Naive Bayes   NB   15 21 .
