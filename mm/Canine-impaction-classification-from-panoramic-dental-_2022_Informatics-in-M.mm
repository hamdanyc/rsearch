      <node TEXT="Warford et al.  1  conducted a study to predict maxillary canine  impaction in its early stages using sectors and angular measurement  methods. To conclude  CNN is a widely used deep learning model in the  medical image processing and classification research field. It was also  observed that there is a limited number of research studies on canine  impaction. One paper that applied deep learning for canine impaction classifi   cation was found ahead of this study  which used a different method   features  and classes. 6 below shows the  distribution of samples in each class before and after under sampling. Several tech  niques can be used for preprocessing to enhance the learning process. In  this study  pixel rescaling  image resize  augmentation  and resolution  enhancement were applied." />

      <node TEXT="In our research  we applied Pixel rescaling with a factor  of 1. 255 which will transform each pixel value from the range  0 255   to  0 1 .

      <node TEXT="However  radiographic images play an impor   tant role and enable proper localization to evaluate impacted maxillary  canines. Panoramic radiograph is a standard screening tool utilized by  orthodontists and other dental specialists alike. Early identification of  canine impaction on panoramic radiograph is crucial for dentists  as it  can facilitate the treatment phase and shorten its duration. Moreover   predicting the occurrence of canine impaction and how well a patient  responds to preventive treatment  as well as determining the appro   priate time for treatment intervention  are complicated and time   consuming processes for dentists. CNNs are a supervised learning mechanism that has demonstrated sig  nificant performance in medical applications. In terms  of dentistry  it can perform multiple tasks on dental radiographic im  ages  including detection  segmentation  and classification  12 .
