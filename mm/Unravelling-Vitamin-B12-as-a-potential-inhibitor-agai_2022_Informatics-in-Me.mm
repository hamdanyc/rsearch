      <node TEXT="It is well known that folate intake is essential for human health  because it prevents megaloblastic anemia and neural tube birth defects  as well as cardiovascular disease  dementia  cognitive function alter  ations  osteoporosis and several types of cancer. While another work  16  explained that vitamin B9 inactivates  protease 3CLpro  which is vital in the replication of all coronaviruses. Laboratory experiments  have proven the protective effect of B15 on coronary artery occlusion  and myocarditis in animals. Mature S glycoprotein on the viral surface is a highly glycosy   lated trimer with 1260 amino acids  residues 14 1273  in each proto   mer. In this study  we also observed that all viral targets have  decent hydrophobic interactions with vitamins. Klebe in 2015 reported  that binding affinity of several ligands is very high due to hydrophobic  interactions. Vitamin D  absorbed from diet and dietary supplements is converted to its biologi   cally active form inside the human body." />
