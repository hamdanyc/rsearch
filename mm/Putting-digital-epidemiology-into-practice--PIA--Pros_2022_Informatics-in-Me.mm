In addition  emerging research topics  e.g. pandemics like the current SARS CoV 2  demand a flexible  approach regarding content while allowing for complex and varying study designs. To meet these needs  we  developed an eResearch system for prospective monitoring and management of incident health events  PIA . The backend consists of services and databases  which are all containerised using Docker  containers. Background  A major challenge in epidemiologic cohort studies is to achieve high  response and long term compliance of participants  1 . Study fatigue is especially problematic if research questions require repeated partici   pants   responses or the collection of biosamples that aim at catching a  transient biological situation.

      <node TEXT="Notifications to mobile devices and web browsers are  sent using Google s Firebase Cloud Messaging Service  FCM  which is  used in a way that respects data protection. As symptom diary  health information  is transmitted from qPIA to SORMAS via a dedicated application pro  gramming interface  API . Scalability  Horizontal scalability  i.e. scaling by adding more machines rather  than increasing the machines  power  was achieved by the use of  container technology in combination with stateless Representational  State Transfer  REST  APIs. The consent manager has access to a separate  database  ewPIA  that contains only consents and withdrawals. Researchers can  implement algorithms for displaying a network of conditional ques  tionnaires after specific data entry events. For other documentation purposes  e.g. of  vaccination cards  the invitation to take pictures can be integrated into  questionnaires. The research team sees all questionnaire data  including  laboratory reports  and can export them." />
      <node TEXT="The main lesson learned from developing PIA includes that the  integration of various experts are paramount who embody sufficient  understanding in information technology  IT security  data protection   user experience  scientific methods  epidemiology and biomedicine  while bridging differences in work style  methods and terminologies of  these different disciplines. Their absence would result in underestima   tion of time and resources needed for building such a comprehensive  eResearch system. The software solution is characterised by flexibility in content   comprehensive options for questionnaire implementation  many func  tions relevant to epidemiological research  role concept  integration of  biosamples  and a high standard of data protection and IT security. We also thank all users of PIA  participants and professional roles   for giving us feedback. A special thanks goes to Adrian Karsten  who  developed the very first version of PIA.

      <node TEXT="Longitudinal data capture is also  required in the field of recurring health events like asthma or angina  pectoris episodes. In infectious disease epidemiology the ability for real time response  is an additional requirement e.g. because of symptomatic biosample  collection. The use of open standards should be  applied wherever possible to support such scalability  flexibility and  sustainability. To avoid human  error of users  automation including adjustable real time data validation  should be applied wherever possible. This tool is flexible with respect to content of the questions to be posed  but does not allow in  dividual  event based surveys or other kind of feedback procedures and  is also not designed for study management. However  the focus of these electronic data capture systems is on  comprehensive data collection and management  even in areas with  poor network connections offline  by professional personnel  less on  participant adherence to repeated self administered questionnaires  self   sampling of biospecimens including feedback and  hence  long term use  in epidemiological studies. We therefore developed a novel tool  which aims at offering all of the  required functionalities and design features within one system." />
