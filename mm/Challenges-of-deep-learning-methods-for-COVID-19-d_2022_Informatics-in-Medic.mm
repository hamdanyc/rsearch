Although the reported outcomes are very high in most cases  these results were obtained without an independent test set from a separate data source s . Similar outcomes are noticed in multi class categorization tasks for single  multiple  and independent data sources  highlighting the challenges in developing DL models with the existing public datasets without an independent test set from a separate dataset. Our source codes and model are publicly available1for the research community for further improvements. The clinical attributes of severe COVID  19epidemic are bronchop  neumonia that causes cough  fever  dyspnea  and subtle respiratory anxiety ailment   3 5 . The clinical screening test for COVID  19is Re  verse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction  RT PCR  using respi  ratory specimens." />

An efficient Grayscale Spatial Exploitation Net  GSEN  is designed by employing web pages crawling across cloud computing environments in  61   utilizing the accuracy rates improvement in a positive relationship to the cardinality of crawled CXR dataset. An application specific hardware architecture had been incorporated by carefully exploiting the data flow and resource availability. These published works reported high COVID 19 binary classification accuracy using either CT scans or CXRs  13 34 35 45 54 64 71 . Although the reported metrics  such as sensitivity and or specificity  are very high in most cases  these results are obtained on cross validation studies without an independent test setcoming from a separate dataset having biases  such as the two classes predicted from two unique datasets. Many recent studies proposing COVID 19 classification based on DL using imaging data do not emphasize the importance of avoiding overfitting and having an independent test set with images from a separate dataset than the training and validation dataset. For each binary  CL2  or multi class  CL3 CL4  classification task  we design experiments to study the impact of having single separate vs. multiple mixed sources of data for individual classes during training  labeled Single and Multiple   respectively." />

Furthermore  the RT PCR kit is estimated to cost around 120   130 USD and requires a specially designed biosafety laboratory to house the PCR unit  each of which can cost 15 000   90 000USD   8 . However  it is observed that most of the COVID  19cases have common characteristics on radiographic images  such as Computed Tomography  CT  and Chest X ray  CXR   including bilateral  multi  focal  ground glass opacities with a peripheral or posterior distribution  mainly in the lower lobes and early  and late stage pulmonary consol  idation   10 13 . Currently  deep Convo  lutional Neural Networks  CNNs  allow for building an end to end model  without the need for manual feature extraction   15 16   which have demonstrated tremendous success in many domains of medical imaging  such as arrhythmia detection   17 19   skin lesion segmenta  tion and classification   20 24   breast cancer detection   25 27   brain disease classification   28   pneumonia detection from CXR images   29   fundus image segmentation   30 31   minimally invasive surgery   32  and lung segmentation   33 . Several deep CNN based methods have been published to detect COVID 19 from CXR and CT images. Though the results obtained are promising  they exhibit limited scope as a CAD tool. To accelerate the development of DL tools that could be utilized in realistic clinical settings  the scientific community needs to emphasize more on making publicly systematically designed and documented datasets that have information  such as inclusion and exclusion criteria  symptomatic vs. asymptomatic cases  and the disease severity stage at which these images were taken." />
      <node TEXT="The results show that many current DL based methods for COVID 19 classification over estimate their performance. CVR Net  architecture detailed in Section 4.2  uses multiple branches and aggregates information from different scales  creating a form of ensembling within a single network that seems to be more robust than other DL models  such as VGG  Xception  ResNet  Inception  DenseNet  and EfficientNet  as seen in Table 5. Table 5 shows higher accuracy when using CXR images compared to CT. We utilized 2D slices rather than the whole CT volume  which was not publicly available for most experimental setups. CT volume may capture details of 3D spatial information  potentially missed in these 2D slices manually selected. Thus  we cannot conclude from the results that CXR is more sensitive than CT for COVID 19 diagnosis. Building a dataset containing these details may help identify the sensitivity of CXR vs. CT at different stages and symptom severity. However  the CXRs images can be a good choice for COVID 19 recognition as it has better performance in our experimentation  especially where CT is unavailable to collect." />
