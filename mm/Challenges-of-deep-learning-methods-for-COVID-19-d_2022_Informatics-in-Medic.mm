Several deep CNN based methods have been published to detect COVID 19 from CXR and CT images. Though the results obtained are promising  they exhibit limited scope as a CAD tool." />
      <node TEXT="Ozkaya et al.  46  extracted deep features using VGG  16  GoogleNet  47   and ResNet  50models  which were classified by Support Vector Machine  SVM   48  with linear kernel function. An application specific hardware architecture had been incorporated by carefully exploiting the data flow and resource availability. Although the reported metrics  such as sensitivity and or specificity  are very high in most cases  these results are obtained on cross validation studies without an independent test setcoming from a separate dataset having biases  such as the two classes predicted from two unique datasets." />
