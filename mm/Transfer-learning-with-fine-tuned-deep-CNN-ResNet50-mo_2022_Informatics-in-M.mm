      <node TEXT="We utilized those pre trained weights and applied the transfer learning approach on a different chest X ray images dataset for classifying Covid or Normal patients. In medical imaging systems  DL models are therefore widely accepted as they can automatically extract features or use some pre trained networks like ResNet  25 . There are four categories  Covid  Lung Opacity  Viral Pneumonia  and Normal  of chest X ray  CXR  images in this database." />
