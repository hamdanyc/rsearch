Furthermore  RT qPCR on 50 BD samples and 50 healthy controls was performed to  validate the in silico results. 1.Introduction  Non coding RNAs comprise a large proportion of human tran  scriptome mainly with no known encoded protein  however  they have  been found to play essential roles in regulation of cellular functions such  as cell cycle and proliferation  1 . Moreover  microRNAs  miRNAs   long  non coding RNAs  lncRNAs   and circular RNAs  circRNAs  are the main  classes of ncRNAs with have been associated with several human dis  eases particularly various types of cancer and therefore  suggested as  potential biomarkers with applications in diagnosis  prediction of  prognosis  and treatment  2 . MiRNAs have shown expression dysre   gulation with potential applications in psychiatric disorders like  schizophrenia  3 .

Modified NOS  signaling has been associated with the pathophysiology of BD  35 37 . Based on experiments  patients with BD had a more increased level  of Uric Acid  particularly in mania seizures. Uric Acid may be a potential  biomarker to indicate BD  40 . Besides all these investigations and in silico analytic results  we also  conducted a series of experiments on 50 BD patients compared to normal  individuals  which had the same results from statistical studies. Our findings  imply that these two miRNAs may be biomarker candidates for BD." />

Another weakness would be that DSM promotes a mechanical approach  to mental disorder assessment. Currently  no neuro   imaging method or laboratory test is available for helping early diag  nosis of BD patients  15 . Genome wide association studies  GWASs  have led to valuable insights  into the genetic etiology of BD. The largest such study has been con  ducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium  PGC   in which  genome wide SNP data from 29 764 patients with BD and 169 118  controls were analyzed and 30 genome wide significant loci were  identified  PGC2   16   Thus  precise medicine is expected to help  development of biomarkers with potentials of differentiating BD pa  tients or susceptible individuals from healthy people  which accordingly  can benefit the early diagnosis of the disorder  15 .
