Since there was no standard case in  Iran  a review of evidence including articles  international reports   standards  and guidelines was completed to prepare the initial KTPHR  model. Over recent decades  the use of PHR is rapidly expanding. From AHIMA s perspective  developing a common dataset can be a  starting point although there is no single path to global PHR  90 . According to the re  searchers  no similar study was found for comparison purposes." />

The study results suggested a model for KTPHR tools to involve pa  tients in their self care process. Few studies have been thus far conducted in relation to PHR and self   care. The important thing originates from different aspects of self care in  various investigations. Consequently  the results of these studies have been  affected by some limitations and biases.

      <node TEXT="About 54   of ESRD patients in Iran are also undergoing hemodialysis  and the rest  experiences kidney transplants  23 . Studies have further shown that patients suffering from kidney dis  ease are facing numerous challenges in terms of self care  including  complex decision making  frequent hospitalizations  27   the manage   ment of blood pressure  weight  total cholesterol  and blood sugar  fluid  intake  diet changes  drug compliance  and physical activities. It is important to  note that there has been no waiting list in Iran since 1999  32 . A review of existing study conducted the increasing future de  mands for such therapy in Iran  33 . Providing help during self care for chronic conditions  particularly  CKD is thus possible through a PHR. A PHR lays emphasis on patient empowerment and better patient   doctor interaction to improve health care quality as a reliable proced   ure to implement an electronic health record  EHR   which can boost  clinical decision making along with comprehensive data collection  38 . With regard to upgrading paper based PHR into electronic ones   there is a consensus that the digitization of health records can help retain  information over time  and such information consequently leads to  improved availability of health services and their consequences  46 ." />

It should be  noted that no time limits were considered to include all articles on  KTPHR. The information item was  thus effective in identifying some items such as BUN  Cr  etc. C  Confirming article quality  using a rating checklist with reference  to the study entitled  Diabetic personal health record  A sys  tematic review article   53   the selected studies were evaluated. The second phase was associated with designing the mobile based  KTPHR app  which was done by an app professional designer within  approximately one to two months.

All  the tasks took place in a completely quiet environment. As a result  these findings were investigated to  provide some recommendations for the app redesign. The KTPHR was a mobile based app to help KTPs manage their  health information and self care.
