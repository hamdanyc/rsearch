The use of information dashboards at the beginning  of the outbreak plays an important role in empowering managers and  officials at different levels of management to make appropriate and  effective decisions and encourages managers to make evidence based  decisions. It is suggested that further studies be conducted on the  design of dashboards and dashboard manufacturing tools to provide a  basis for further development of these tools for possible future epidemic and pandemic conditions. Due to their nature  national dash  boards can be effective in managerial and health aspects  31 . Its various  users can obtain their information at the national level and specific re  gions.

It is recommended to develop dashboards despite the data generated in hospitals and other care cen  ters such as laboratories. The use of these indicators  provides valuable information to researchers. However  Python   MATLAB  QlikView  and Tablea software were also used. Given that the  present study has examined all the important aspects of Covid 19  dashboards over a year of its prevalence  the results of the study can  be used to upgrade existing Covid 19 dashboards and develop new  dashboards in the field of epidemics and possible future pandemics to be  used by policymakers and designers of Covid 19 dashboards.

These information systems have played an important role in managing and controlling epidemic  diseases  especially Covid 19. This study aimed to identify the applications  features  and key indicators of  advanced dashboards in Covid 19. 1.Introduction  Covid 19 was declared an epidemic disease by the World Health  Organization  WHO  on March 11  2020  1 . One of the most  effective and widely used solutions for managing Covid 19 is informa   tion technology  4 5 . Dashboards are one of the most widely used  information technologies in Covid 19 management  10 11 .

Dashboards effectively integrate and properly dissemi   nate information as part of decision support systems  14 . Although all the dashboards studied included epidemiolog   ical indicators  a limited number of them stated their main purpose and  intended users. Almost a quarter of the dashboards  studied did not report their data sources  18 . In another study  Ibrahim et al.  conducted a study to develop and use a clinical intelligent dashboard for  frontline physicians to optimize important resources along covid 19   which could interact and receive information from the electronic  health record  EHR   21 . Articles related to other  dashboards  non interactive  and monitoring systems were excluded. 3  the data sources of Covid 19 dashboards are  divided into five main categories." />
