      <node TEXT="For example  GRU learned well and performed  identically with both sequence sizes in all four prediction tasks. 5.Discussion  This study compared sequential learning RNN and traditional ML  models using diagnosis codes extracted from EHR data for four common  cancers. In some cases  the GRU model  achieved slightly better accuracy and AUROC score using an embedding  layer. Thus  insufficient  training samples made it difficult for sequential learning models to find  the temporal correlation between patient diagnoses. Although  we applied SVD  which is considered suitable for dimensionality  reduction under such conditions  the insufficient number of examples  may still be an obstacle in sequential learning. However   we need to emphasize that the patient  s age was not explicitly utilized as  a prediction feature. It  allows for neither learning abstract patient representations nor  capturing any temporal correlations between patients   diagnoses." />
      <node TEXT="Medical image  analysis is also essential in today  s medicine  but it requires a significant  set of labeled data and appropriate ML techniques to make accurate  predictions. The  dominating power of CNNs in medical fields was also confirmed by  predicting lung cancer from CT imaging data  13 . Experiments aimed at predicting breast can  cer using several traditional ML models showed that SVM was the best  performing model with an accuracy of 0.979  16 . Atrey  et al.  25  tried a dominance based filtering approach to find the most  important features for predicting breast cancer. Another liver disease study showed that the J48 decision tree algo  rithm could be beneficial in this topic with 0.507 mean absolute error   30 . Like in most previously mentioned papers  the predictions  were also based on a small number of attributes. Another deep learning ensemble method was used for feature extraction  from EHRs of 1000 patients to predict lung cancer treatment failure   33 ." />

      <node TEXT="This paper showed a successful approach for utilizing EHR data in  predicting the four most common cancers. Frequent updates with new patient informa   tion make EHR databases sequential and information rich. Finally   the results of four classification tasks on a substantially large dataset  support our claims and hypotheses. First  as we already mentioned   EHR databases are not utilized to collect information for research. Therefore  datasets of this type are often sparse and noisy  making them  difficult to examine closely. In that case  we could significantly increase Table 5  Accuracy of the models trained with 5  10  25  and 50 visits hospitalizations  sequences.

We also add up bias by of all  neurons in the network. The first model contains layers with LSTM units capable of learning  long term dependencies in sequential data. A potential problem with training neural networks could be the  number of epochs. As a result  both RNN models were trained through 20  epochs unless stopped earlier by the method mentioned above.
