      <node TEXT="Medical image  analysis is also essential in today  s medicine  but it requires a significant  set of labeled data and appropriate ML techniques to make accurate  predictions. Experiments aimed at predicting breast can  cer using several traditional ML models showed that SVM was the best  performing model with an accuracy of 0.979  16 . Another liver disease study showed that the J48 decision tree algo  rithm could be beneficial in this topic with 0.507 mean absolute error   30 ." />
      <node TEXT="The first model contains layers with LSTM units capable of learning  long term dependencies in sequential data. As a result  both RNN models were trained through 20  epochs unless stopped earlier by the method mentioned above. Furthermore  a smaller size was cho  sen because it is reported across many applications that using such small  Fig." />
      <node TEXT="5.Discussion  This study compared sequential learning RNN and traditional ML  models using diagnosis codes extracted from EHR data for four common  cancers. Thus  insufficient  training samples made it difficult for sequential learning models to find  the temporal correlation between patient diagnoses. Although  we applied SVD  which is considered suitable for dimensionality  reduction under such conditions  the insufficient number of examples  may still be an obstacle in sequential learning." />
      <node TEXT="This paper showed a successful approach for utilizing EHR data in  predicting the four most common cancers. Finally   the results of four classification tasks on a substantially large dataset  support our claims and hypotheses. In that case  we could significantly increase Table 5  Accuracy of the models trained with 5  10  25  and 50 visits hospitalizations  sequences." />
      <node TEXT="Comparisons of all six prediction models for each cancer dataset are  shown in Figs. GRU generally obtained the best performance across the six evalu   ation metrics on all datasets  with 2 18  higher accuracy and a  considerably higher AUROC score  between 0.87 and 0.94  than all al  ternatives. For example  there was far less padding in  up to 5  than in the  up to  Table 3  Results of sequential learning  LSTM and GRU  and traditional models  MLP  RF  DT  KNN  trained on the four cancer datasets after creating 300 SVD features for each  dataset." />
