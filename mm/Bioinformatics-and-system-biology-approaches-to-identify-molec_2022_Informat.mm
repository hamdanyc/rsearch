      <node TEXT="Several metabolic comorbidities like polycystic ovarian syndrome  PCOS    type 2 diabetes  T2D   obesity  and cardiovascular disease  CVD  have been associated with female infertility   FI . Here  we have used differentially  expressed genes  DEGs  to uncover various biological targets for a better understanding of FI and metabolic  comorbidities development. Later life health risk  development such as polycystic ovarian syndrome  PCOS   cardiovas   cular disease  CVD   type 2 diabetes  T2D   and obesity could be an early  indication of female infertility  5 ." />

      <node TEXT="To investigate the impact of FI and its genetic relationship with  other metabolic comorbidities  we collected and analyzed relevant  microarray datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Infor  mation Gene Expression Omnibus database. This transformation  allows for a straightforward comparison of gene expression data in  various models and disorders. Finally  the gene disease  association network  GDN  was created and visualized in Cytoscape  v3.8.2  42 ." />
      <node TEXT="The model is designed to show how numerous  disorders interact through gene regulation and biological processes. Several associated nodes  in a PPI network are designated as hub proteins at the same time. 6.The Enriched  A  KEGG and  B  WIKI pathways are generated from common differentially expressed genes." />
