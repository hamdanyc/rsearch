      <node TEXT="SVM  We divided our entire subset into two classes for this section and then  used a GridSearch with a weighted score to determine the best param   eters to use with this supervised model. Our SVM model was initially tested with  both complete subsets  but the results were inconclusive. With a ten fold Grid Search cross validation we tried the following  parameters  kernel values  RBF and polynomial  penalization value  C   as a list with values ranging from 10 2 to 102  degrees for the poly  nomial kernel ranging from 2 to 5  gamma as a list with values ranging  from 10 6 to 30." />
      <node TEXT="Previous studies using this approach  include the work of Guti errez C  ardenas and Wang  13 14   who used  sequence based features to identify non coding RNAs with genes  involved in breast cancer scenarios. Sequence alignment  When comparing two different DNA or RNA strands  one method for  determining similarities is to compare their nucleotide information  using a scoring function. In  addition  unlike traditional SVM models  which require at least two  categories  this model allows for outlier detection using only one class." />
