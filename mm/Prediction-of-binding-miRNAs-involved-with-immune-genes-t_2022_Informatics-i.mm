      <node TEXT="SVM  We divided our entire subset into two classes for this section and then  used a GridSearch with a weighted score to determine the best param   eters to use with this supervised model. Using the data from the  InnateDB database  we created a list of 818 miRNAs that interact with  genes involved in immunological processes  and other 1730 miRNAs that act as their counterparts. Our SVM model was initially tested with  both complete subsets  but the results were inconclusive. With no  defined values for sensitivity and specificity  we obtained an accuracy of  67.84  with the entire dataset. The true positive value was zero  and  the false negative value was also zero. With a ten fold Grid Search cross validation we tried the following  parameters  kernel values  RBF and polynomial  penalization value  C   as a list with values ranging from 10 2 to 102  degrees for the poly  nomial kernel ranging from 2 to 5  gamma as a list with values ranging  from 10 6 to 30.

Random Forest  We proceeded to select the best hyperparameters that could be  suitable for our model after dividing our data into positive and negative  samples  as the SVM model previously mentioned. We obtained an  accuracy of approximately 82.88  in the test set with these hyper   parameters  promising similar results as before  however  we discovered  a type II error with no values for the true negative class again  see  Table 4b. Unsupervised One class SVM comparison with supervised models  We started by using a Grid Search algorithm to select the best  hyperparameters. This method of data selection is similar to using a  cross validation model.

      <node TEXT="Gasparello  et al.  26  discovered that hsa miR 450a 5p may bind to the IL 8 gene   which is involved in cytokine storms  and that this biomarker is one of  the predictors of patient survival when they are hospitalized. Using a pair of supervised machine learning models and one unsu  pervised model  we used features extracted from the sequences of these  miRNAs to the 5 UTR region of the SARS COV 2 virus to find some  match between these miRNAs and this viral form. We discovered that the results of using two class supervised models  were a little misleading. This was due to the fact that  despite having an  acceptable level of accuracy of around 82  for both models  we  concluded that no true negative samples were correctly classified when  we validated our confusion matrices. In terms of  potential treatments  Klinger et al.  31  found that drugs targeting the  cyclin dependent kinase 6  CDK6  are important for treating patients  with this disease. M ller et al.  32  discovered that SYT4 was  down regulated after a SARS CoV 2 infection  however  while the au  thors establish a link between this gene and beta cell physiology or  diabetes  other authors  such as Jiang et al.  33   discovered a link be  tween this gene and immune cells. One limitation of the current study is that potential pathways be  tween the discovered miRNAs and other cellular components or func  tions must be validated using genome wide association studies." />
      <node TEXT="Moreover  some authors  such as  Mukhopadhyay et al.  11   demonstrate that this untranslated region  contains many conserved regions of about 90 nucleotides. Previous studies using this approach  include the work of Guti errez C  ardenas and Wang  13 14   who used  sequence based features to identify non coding RNAs with genes  involved in breast cancer scenarios. Sequence alignment  When comparing two different DNA or RNA strands  one method for  determining similarities is to compare their nucleotide information  using a scoring function. We can observe some comple   mentary sequences that have their nucleotides aligned in the middle. It is usually formed by using a sliding  window of n characters  for example  if we have the following DNA  string   AAACCTGGACCTT  And if we want to form a 2 mer  we could join each par of nucleotides  and advance the string to the right by a sliding window of two characters  giving us   AA  AA  AC  CC  CT. The use of k mers has different applications in bioinformatics  such  as the reconstruction of genetic material given their partial sequences  and finding shared k mers between sequences that could serve to find  gene similarities. In  addition  unlike traditional SVM models  which require at least two  categories  this model allows for outlier detection using only one class." />
