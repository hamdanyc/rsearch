      <node TEXT="Subtyping of diseases plays a dominant role in precision medicine  it involves allocating individuals suffering from seemingly the same disease into homogeneous sub populations  supposedly sharing similar clinical and molecular characteristics   3 4 . Meanwhile  numerous machine learning and statistical techniques such as non negative matrix factorization  consensus clus  tering  hierarchical clustering have been tailored to discover disease subtypes that better correlate with clinical outcomes than traditional classification methods   9 13 . Also  several methods that integrate multi omics data such as miRNA  methylation or copy number variation for the same cohort have been developed to discover cancer subtypes." />

      <node TEXT="For example   35  were able to classify adreno  cortical carcinoma into two distinct groups correlating with patient survival from mRNA expression data using UMAP. To provide guard against noise and outliers in the data  we use Gaussian mixture model  MBC  based clustering for subtyping cancer patients. However  MBC suffers from instability even with few atypical observa  tions which are common in gene expression data." />
