      <node TEXT="Methods  We propose a robust framework for clustering cancer patients into molecular subtypes by leveraging gene expression data. The framework is based on UMAP and an adaptive to noise robust clustering method OTRIMLE. Results  The resulting framework is tested on five datasets of cancer obtained from TCGA  and the results are evaluated by comparing with Neighbourhood based multi omics  NEMO   Similarity Network Fusion  SNF  and Consensus Clustering  CC . Subtyping of diseases plays a dominant role in precision medicine  it involves allocating individuals suffering from seemingly the same disease into homogeneous sub populations  supposedly sharing similar clinical and molecular characteristics   3 4 .

Rather .Recent advances in high throughput technologies have made it sim  ple and cost effective to gather different omics profiles from patients. Meanwhile  numerous machine learning and statistical techniques such as non negative matrix factorization  consensus clus  tering  hierarchical clustering have been tailored to discover disease subtypes that better correlate with clinical outcomes than traditional classification methods   9 13 . Also  several methods that integrate multi omics data such as miRNA  methylation or copy number variation for the same cohort have been developed to discover cancer subtypes." />

      <node TEXT="UMAP has found widespread applications in biomedical research and is emerging as new choice for bioinformaticians. For example   35  were able to classify adreno  cortical carcinoma into two distinct groups correlating with patient survival from mRNA expression data using UMAP. 37  developed a molecular classification technique to classify renal carcinoma into different subtypes using transcriptomics data with UMAP. To provide guard against noise and outliers in the data  we use Gaussian mixture model  MBC  based clustering for subtyping cancer patients. Our aim is to cluster low dimensional embedding generated by UMAP     with     dimensions and  observations into  Gaussian components. However  MBC suffers from instability even with few atypical observa  tions which are common in gene expression data. For ex  ample   42 43  suggested fitting noise outliers included in the data by adding uniform distribution to mixture components." />

      <node TEXT="Impute missing values in gene expression matrix by using MAD based imputation. b  Identify samples modelled as noise component  if any   and remove them. The final clustering solution maximizing subtype specific sur  vival curves measured in terms of        is chosen for evalu  ation. PH does not apply in such cases  and hazard ratio results could be misleading. However  due to their lack of biological interpretation  they are not considered here. The intent is to obtain clusters with high separability between them in terms of Kaplan Meier plots. The advantage of this method is that it does not rely on proportional hazards assumption." />
